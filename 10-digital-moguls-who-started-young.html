Greg Tseng and Johann Schleier-Smith - Tagged</h2><p>Tseng and Schleier-Smith, both aged 34, met in a middle school science class and became fast friends.&nbsp; The pair went off to Harvard together and both majored in Physics and Math.&nbsp; In 2004, they invented Tagged, a social networking site that distinguished itself from other players like Facebook and Myspace in that the site worked to help you meet new people, as opposed to simply communicating with those you already know.&nbsp; The site has drawn many complaints about spamming, and Time magazine coined it "the world's most annoying website" in 2009.&nbsp; Yikes.</p><p></p><h2 id=jake-nickell--threadless>9. Jake Nickell- Threadless</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Threadless is a t-shirt company that sells designs submitted by users around the world and then voted on by other users.&nbsp; The most popular designs are then produced and sold, with the designer getting a $2,000 payout and store credit for their troubles.&nbsp; The site was born when Nickell (33), then a design student, entered a t-shirt design contest on a website.&nbsp; He won the prize but his t-shirt was never produced.&nbsp; He thought this was pointless, and lo, a genius idea was conceived.</p><p></p><h2 id=alexander-levin--imageshack>8. Alexander Levin- ImageShack</h2><p>Levin, 26, started his image storing and sharing site in 2003.&nbsp; ImageShack initially was a free service that made money by placing ads over the photos, but in early 2014, the company switched to a paid subscription service.&nbsp; Levin is worth $56 million.</p><p></p><h2 id=john-vechey--popcap-games>7. John Vechey- PopCap Games</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Vechey (31), who grew up poor in Indiana, founded PopCap in 2000 with friends Brian Fiete and Jason Kapalka.&nbsp; The company is best known for the game Bejeweled and currently has a range of 35 games on offer for a variety of gaming platforms.&nbsp; Bejeweled has sold over 50 million units and PopCap was sold to Electronic Arts in 2011 for $1.3 billion.&nbsp; Vechey himself is worth $60 million.&nbsp; Not bad for a twenty-first century version of Tetris.</p><p></p><h2 id=angelo-sotira---deviantart>6. Angelo Sotira - DeviantART</h2><p>Angelo Sotira (33) is the founder of DeviantART, an online community for artists founded in 2000.&nbsp; DeviantART has 14 million members and was one of the first sites to rely on user generated content.&nbsp; Approximately 155,000 "deviations" or pieces of artwork are uploaded daily, garnering an average of 1.5 million comments in a 24 hour period.&nbsp; The site creates revenue by offering premium memberships and by selling a variety of virtual and tangible products.&nbsp; He is worth $75 million.</p><p></p><h2 id=andrew-michael---fasthosts>5. Andrew Michael - Fasthosts</h2><p>Michael (32), a UK resident born in Cyprus, started Fasthosts in 1999 as part of a high school project.&nbsp; The program provides email and internet service to small businesses and was sold for 61 million pounds in 2006.&nbsp; His net worth is $120 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=blake-ross-and-david-hyatt--mozilla-firefox>4. Blake Ross and David Hyatt- Mozilla Firefox</h2><p><a title="Blake Ross Net Worth" href=#>Ross</a> (28) and <a title="Dave Hyatt Net Worth" href=#>Hyatt</a> (41) co-developed Mozilla's Firefox internet browser.&nbsp; Ross, a Florida native, got his start writing code for Netscape at the young age of 15.&nbsp;&nbsp; He attended Stanford University and was only 17 at the time he co-created Firefox.&nbsp; Hyatt, a graduate of Rice University, worked as a Netscape employee from 1997-2002 and currently works for Apple.&nbsp; Both are worth a reported $120 million.</p><p></p><h2 id=chad-hurley---youtube>3. Chad Hurley - Youtube</h2><p><a title="Chad Hurley Net Worth" href=#>Hurley</a>, 36, cofounded Youtube, the video sharing site, in 2005.&nbsp; Youtube enjoys universal usage: approximately 100 million video clips are viewed each day, with 65,000 new videos being uploaded daily.&nbsp; You can thank him for hours wasted watching videos of cats playing the piano and teenage guys punching each other in the junk in the hopes of becoming viral stars.&nbsp; Hurley sold Youtube to Google in 2006 for $1.65 billion in stocks and is worth&nbsp; $300 million, making him the third richest entrepreneur on our list.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=andrew-gower---runescape>2.

Mark Zuckerberg- Facebook, 29</h2><p>It should be no surprise that our most impressive young internet entrepreneur is none other than <a title="Mark Zuckerberg Net Worth" href=#>Mark Zuckerberg</a>.&nbsp; 29 year old Zuckerberg was a computer genius from a young age.&nbsp; As a child, he invented a computer program called Zucknet for his father to use in his dentistry office.&nbsp; He also used Zucknet to communicate with friends and family.&nbsp; Zuckerberg's parents realized that their son had a rare talent and paid for him to have private tutoring in computers where apparently, it was difficult for his tutor to stay ahead of him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After graduating from high school, Zuckerberg headed to Harvard, where he co-founded Facebook.&nbsp; He dropped out after his sophomore year in order to focus full time on the social networking site, and currently serves as its CEO.&nbsp; Zuckerberg is reportedly worth $28.7 billion and was the youngest CEO to ever appear on the Fortune 500 list in 2013.&nbsp; Despite his vast wealth, Zuckerberg is also a devoted philanthropist.&nbsp; He signed the Giving Pledge, which states that he will give 50 percent of his wealth to charity.&nbsp; Since he's worth $13.3 billion, that's a whole lot of money for charity.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZmpoXZm2qLXTmqNmpZ%2Bcwq2%2FjLCfqGWjqa6zwMSdZLKnpaO0cA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f10-digital-moguls-who-started-young.html&text=10%20Digital%20Moguls%20Who%20Started%20Young&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-digital-moguls-who-started-young.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-digital-moguls-who-started-young.html&title=10%20Digital%20Moguls%20Who%20Started%20Young" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f10-digital-moguls-who-started-young.html&title=10%20Digital%20Moguls%20Who%20Started%20Young" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f10-digital-moguls-who-started-young.html&title=10%20Digital%20Moguls%20Who%20Started%20Young" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-digital-moguls-who-started-young.html&description=10%20Digital%20Moguls%20Who%20Started%20Young" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./5-amazingly-elaborate-heists-that-became-movies.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="5 Amazingly Elaborate Heists That Became Movies">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./vince-mcmahon-s-net-worth-in-2022-the-entertainment-industry-s-future.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Vince McMahons Net Worth In 2022: The Entertainment Industrys Future">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
