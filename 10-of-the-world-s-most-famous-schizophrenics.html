Many people don't fully understand schizophrenia and are afraid to explore the details of the condition. Like many psychological conditions, schizophrenia can range in terms of intensity, and affects people in different ways.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>People who have schizophrenia can exhibit minor characteristics like being forgetful and disorganized. Some can display symptoms that are much more serious, such as being delusional and listening to voices in their head that encourage them to harm others. Unfortunately, some criminals have committed horrible acts as a result of this mental condition. It is also important to note that multiple personality disorder is different from schizophrenia, although the two conditions are often viewed as the same disease. Also, contrary to popular opinion, schizophrenia isn't exactly an uncommon condition. HelpGuide.org suggests that about 1 in 100 people will develop schizophrenia at some point in their lives.</p><p>Medical advances make it possible for people with schizophrenia to live happy and fulfilling lives. Some individuals are able to have healthy family relationships and professional success. Treatments can include medication, counseling and a host of exercises and activities that are designed to recondition the brain.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These ten well-known&nbsp;schizophrenics all suffered to different degrees; some managed to go on to live fulfilling lives while obtaining treatment, while others' lives were irrevocably led down dangerous paths and they became tragically defined by the illness.</p><h2 id=wesley-willis>10. Wesley Willis</h2><p>via wbez.org</p><p>Willis was an artist and musician who received a schizophrenia diagnosis after hearing "demons" in his head. As a result of his episodes, which he referred to as "hell rides," he stated that rock 'n' roll was "joy ride music."</p><p>After his diagnosis, he spent two months in a psychiatric hospital. Willis began his career as a singer and songwriter in the outsider genre. He had a huge following in the 1990s and released his <i>Greatest Hits</i> album in 1995.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His visual art included intricate drawings of city buses and streetscapes of his hometown, Chicago. Many of Willis' episodes occurred while he was riding the city buses of Chicago, which may be why he was inspired to create art that depicted these scenes. Wesley Willis passed away from complications due to leukemia in 2003. He was 40 years old.</p><p></p><h2 id=daniel-johnston>9. Daniel Johnston</h2><p>via trespassmag.com</p><p>Daniel Johnston has been diagnosed with manic depression and schizophrenia.

Lionel Aldridge</h2><p>via jrn.com</p><p>Aldridge was a professional football player. His athletic abilities were so impressive that legendary coach Vince Lombardi decided to use Alridge as a starter, even though he was a rookie in 1963. Lionel Aldridge proved that Lombardi made the right decision, since he helped the Green Bay Packers win the Super Bowl twice.</p><p>Aldridge spent a decade in the NFL, but retired in the late 1970s after he began suffering from schizophrenia. The illness led to a significant amount of turmoil in the ex-athlete's life, and he became homeless in Milwaukee before getting the proper treatment for schizophrenia. This led Alridge to become a spokesperson and advocate for the mentally ill and homeless. Lionel Aldridge passed away in 1998.</p><p></p><h2 id=skip-spence>7.

In the late 1970s, Gordon started developing paranoid schizophrenia, and started to hear voices.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Doctors didn't give him an accurate diagnosis, which meant that Gordon would not receive proper treatment. In 1983, Jim Gordon murdered his mother and is still imprisoned.</p><p></p><h2 id=peter-green>5. Peter Green</h2><p>via rollingstone.com</p><p>Peter Green is a guitarist from Great Britain, and is most well known for being one of the founding members of the legendary group Fleetwood Mac.
