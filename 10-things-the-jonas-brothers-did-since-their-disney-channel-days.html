The first one to get married was Kevin Jonas who married former hairdresser Danielle Deleasa in December 2009, Nick Jonas was the next one as he married actress Priyanka Chopra in December 2018, and last but not least — Joe Jonas married his wife, Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner, in May 2019! The Jonas Brothers may <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">have dated quite a few famous ladies over the years</a> but it finally seems as if all three of them have settled down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=and-kevin-and-joe-already-have-children><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>And Kevin And Joe Already Have Children</span></h2><p>Not only did the Jonas Bros decide to tie the knot with their significant others — but some of them also have offspring. Kevin Jonas and his wife Danielle welcomed their first daughter in 2014 and their second one in 2016, while <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner</a> welcomed their child in 2020 and a photo of it is yet to be shared. Currently, there are plenty of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rumors about Priyanka Chopra being pregnant</a>, so who knows — perhaps Nick Jonas will become a father soon as well!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=the-brothers-embarked-on-pretty-successful-solo-careers><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>The Brothers&nbsp;Embarked On Pretty Successful Solo Careers</span></h2><p>Once the Jonas Bros said goodbye to Disney the band decided to go on a hiatus in 2011, and they used the next couple of years to focus on their solo careers.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="Everything Taylor Momsen’s Been Up To Since Her Gossip Girl Days" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything Taylor Momsen’s Been Up To Since Her Gossip Girl Days</a></span></p><p>Anyone who followed the Jonas Bros post-breakup knows that while Nick and Joe still had plenty of success within the industry — Kevin certainly seemed to have shifted more of his focus towards his private life and his family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=and-joe-jonas-even-joined-another-band-dnce><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>And Joe Jonas Even Joined Another Band — DNCE</span></h2><p>While Nick Jonas continued creating music creating music and performing by himself, Joe Jonas decided to join another band — the dance-rock band DNCE. With it, Joe had quite a bit of success, and their debut single "Cake by the Ocean" was without a doubt one of the biggest hits in 2015. And who knows, perhaps DNCE also decides to reunite and some point and give their fans a few more hits!</p><h2 id=they-reunited-in-2019-and-gave-their-fans-a-heartwarming-documentary><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>They Reunited In 2019 And Gave Their Fans A Heartwarming Documentary</span></h2><p>In 2019 the Jonas Brothers announced their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">very anticipated comeback</a> and soon afterward the band also released their fifth studio album Happiness Begins. Together with the comeback, the Jonas Brothers also released a documentary titled Chasing Happiness which certainly gave their fans plenty of insight into what has been going on in their lives in the past couple of years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=and-together-the-brothers-went-on-tour><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>And Together The Brothers Went On Tour</span></h2><p>While fans absolutely love <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">every single Jonas Brothers music video</a> that the band ever shot — there is no doubt that seeing the siblings perform on stage together is just a whole different experience. In 2019, the brothers embarked on their 10th concert tour called Happiness Begins which began in August 2019 in Miami Florida and concluded in February 2020 in Paris, France.</p><h2 id=nick-performed-on-broadway-and-gave-acting-a-chance><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Nick Performed On Broadway And Gave Acting A Chance</span></h2><p>There are certainly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">quite a few celebs the many may not know actually did Broadway</a> — and Nick Jonas is certainly one of them.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="Everything Millie Bobby Brown Has Done Since Stranger Things Premiered" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything Millie Bobby Brown Has Done Since Stranger Things Premiered</a></span></p><p>The famous musician actually performed on Broadway back when he was a young child, however, in 2012 — during his solo career — Nick decided to return to Broadway and he played&nbsp;J.

As fans who watched it will remember — the show had two seasons and after the second one it was unfortunately canceled.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=and-joe-joined-the-australian-version-of-the-voice><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>And Joe Joined The&nbsp;Australian Version Of The Voice</span></h2><p>Another brother who sort of explored the world of reality television is Joe Jonas. While Joe didn’t necessarily have a show revolving around his life — he did join the popular competition reality television show The Voice Australia as a regular coach during its season seven in 2018. As expected, Joe did a great job and no one would be surprised to see him as a coach or a judge in a singing competition again.</p><h2 id=and-lastly-they-said-goodbye-to-their-disney-channel-image><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>And Lastly, They Said Goodbye To Their Disney Channel Image</span></h2><p>There is absolutely no doubt that the Jonas Bros had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">plenty of defining moments in their career</a> and one of them was saying goodbye to their Disney Channel image. Yes, they rose to fame as teen heartthrobs but nowadays they are well-respected musicians and grown men whose lives as well as music have drastically changed. Of course, the majority of their fans grew up with them — and there is no doubt that they will continue to support the Jonas Bros for the rest of their career!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Everything Scott Disick Has Done Since His Split From Kourtney Kardashian" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything Scott Disick Has Done Since His Split From Kourtney Kardashian</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroaGenMBuwMeeZKOnnpbAbq7RqKuhnaKoeqW1w2aqoqaTmnq1tMSiqWacmai7psWMnJ%2Bapp6auW6wwLKqaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f10-things-the-jonas-brothers-did-since-their-disney-channel-days.html&text=10%20Things%20The%20Jonas%20Brothers%20Did%20Since%20Their%20Disney%20Channel%20Days&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-things-the-jonas-brothers-did-since-their-disney-channel-days.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-things-the-jonas-brothers-did-since-their-disney-channel-days.html&title=10%20Things%20The%20Jonas%20Brothers%20Did%20Since%20Their%20Disney%20Channel%20Days" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f10-things-the-jonas-brothers-did-since-their-disney-channel-days.html&title=10%20Things%20The%20Jonas%20Brothers%20Did%20Since%20Their%20Disney%20Channel%20Days" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f10-things-the-jonas-brothers-did-since-their-disney-channel-days.html&title=10%20Things%20The%20Jonas%20Brothers%20Did%20Since%20Their%20Disney%20Channel%20Days" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-things-the-jonas-brothers-did-since-their-disney-channel-days.html&description=10%20Things%20The%20Jonas%20Brothers%20Did%20Since%20Their%20Disney%20Channel%20Days" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./15-celebrity-love-affairs-that-destroyed-careers.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Celebrity Love Affairs That Destroyed Careers">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./zack-sabre-jr-challenges-bryan-danielson-to-a-rematch-danielson-responds.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Zack Sabre Jr. Challenges Bryan Danielson To A Rematch, Danielson Responds">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
