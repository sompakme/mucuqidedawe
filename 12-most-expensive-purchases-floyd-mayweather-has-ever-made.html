Imagine making more money in one day then you made in your entire last year combined. How would you spend it? What would you do?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>People tend to say that the more money you make, the more problems you’ll come across. But let’s face it. Sitting on nearly half a billion dollars in cash is a fantastic problem to have.&nbsp;<a href=#>Floyd Mayweather</a> is no stranger to hard work. You simply cannot reach the pinnacle of any sport without dedicating your entire life to being the best in the world. The countless hours Mayweather has committed to training and studying the sport of boxing since his childhood is the reason he is in the position he is today; the highest paid athlete on the planet.</p><p>Hate him or love him, the man stinks of success. Whether he deserves the insane paydays he receives for his fights will always remain up for debate. One thing we can all agree on though, is the man knows how to enjoy the fruits of his labour. Here are the 12 most expensive purchases Mayweather has ever made.</p><h2 id=300k-on-a-mercedes-party-bus>12. 300k on a Mercedes Party Bus</h2><p>via:bestchauffeured.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mayweather copped a fully decked out Mercedes Sprinter that set him back 300k. The bus comes equipped with massage chairs, full champagne bar and satellite TV with a surround sound stereo system.</p><p>Chances of you ever coming across one of these bad boys is virtually impossible. This ride was custom built for Mayweather and just screams tailored luxury.</p><p></p><h2 id=400k-on-hermes-bags>11. 400k on Hermes Bags</h2><p>via:pursuitist.com</p><p>Mayweather owns so much luxury clothing and accessories that tallying up the value of them all would be close to impossible. His shopping patterns tend to be erratic and he will splurge on items at any given time.</p><p>One example is the 400k he spent at Hermes in one day when shopping in paris. His pickups? 5 crocodile bags including four travel bags and andorange Birkin Bag.&nbsp;Mayweather posted his purchase on his Instagram account with the caption: “Over $400,000 spent in Hermes cause I stay in my lane”.</p><p>Enough Said.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=750-000-contract-buyout>10. $750,000 Contract Buyout</h2><p>Kind of strange when you think about it. But one of the biggest purchases Mayweather has ever made was in 2006, when he decided to exercise a provision in his contract that gave him the opportunity to become a free agent. He payed a cool 750k to Toprank Promotions to buy out the remainder of his contract and immediately formed his own company.</p><p>This bold move is what laid the foundation for him to become one of the highest paid athletes of all time. By controlling his own destiny, he made sure that no promoters would be able to stick their hands in his pockets and instead, kept all profits from his fights to himself.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-figure-sweet-sixteen-for-his-daughter>9. 7-Figure Sweet Sixteen for his Daughter</h2><p>We’ve all heard stories of celebrities spoiling their kids on their birthdays. But have you ever heard of two of the world’s biggest rappers throwing a private concert for a 16 year old?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mayweather hosted a birthday bash extravaganza at the Mirage Grand Ballroom in Vegas for his daughter's sweet sixteen. The lavish party was headlined by performances by none other than <a href=#>Drake</a> and <a href=#>Future</a>. The party reportedly set Mayweather back 7 figures.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-1-million-dollar-watch>8. 1.1 Million Dollar Watch</h2><p>via:www.autoevolution.com</p><p>Mayweather has accumulated an unfathomable amount of jewelry over the past several years. His collection consisting of diamond encrusted watches, bracelets, chains and rings, have been valued at over 10 million dollars. He has been spotted on many occasions rocking millions of dollars worth of jewelry at once.</p><p>One of his most prized possessions and most expensive purchases is a 1.1 million dollar Hublot watch he picked up in Dubai last year. The timepiece, which is one of the most expensive watches on the planet, has an army of white diamonds encrusted around the entire enclosure.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1-1-million-dollar-bet>7. 1.1 Million Dollar Bet</h2><p>Mayweather is notorious for betting huge sums of money on various sporting events. While being interviewed on <a href=#>Jimmy Fallon’s</a> talk show, Mayweather admitted to betting 1.1 million dollars on the Oregon Ducks back in 2013. He walked away a winner with a cool 1 million dollars.</p><p>Puzzled as to how Mayweather could gamble such a large amount of cash on a sporting event, Fallon told Mayweather: “I wouldn’t be able to watch that, I wouldn’t be able to do anything. I don’t know what I’d do. I would leave the country.”&nbsp;Mayweather shrugged off the conversation, stating ‘It was a cool game”, and acknowledged that he had no problem stomaching the huge bet he placed.</p><p>He clearly isn’t phased by much and has a ton of cash to risk.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-5-million-dollar-miami-penthouse>6. 1.5 Million Dollar Miami Penthouse</h2><p>via:www.celebdigs.com</p><p>Mayweather bought this property in the Saint Tropez condominiums of Sunny Aisles back in 2010. The luxurious 3000 square foot condo has four bedrooms and four bathrooms, and comes with premium furnishings throughout.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He has renovated the property 3 times already and is planning to renovate it a fourth time, even though he hasn’t lived at the property since moving into his Las Vegas home with his kids.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-5-million-dollar-bugatti-veyron>5. 3.5 Million Dollar Bugatti Veyron</h2><p>via:m.forocoches.com</p><p>Chances of you spotting one of these bad boys on the street are slim to none. There are only 400 Bugatti Veyrons available across the world since Bugatti started manufacturing the car in 2005.</p><p>Mayweather is known to own several Bugattis ranging from 2 to 3 million dollars. He flaunts his collection to the media any chance that he gets. He brought his Bugatti collection to another level when he picked up his orange and black Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse in 2015.&nbsp;At a price tag of 3.5 million dollars, you can’t blame him for showing it off. Just to put things into perspective, an oil change and standard service on that car costs over $20,000.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-8-million-dollar-koenigsegg-ccxr-trevita>4. 4.8 Million Dollar Koenigsegg CCXR Trevita</h2><p>via:buzz.eurosport.es</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Floyd Mayweather is famous for his incredible fleet of luxury cars.
