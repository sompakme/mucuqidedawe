Super models, as it turns out, are drawn to money like bees and ants are drawn to honey. They love the lifestyle and are willing to lower their standards when it comes to appearances.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Models have a stigma of being a tad bit high maintenance -&nbsp;and that’s putting it mildly. They become accustomed to a certain lifestyle based solely on their appearance. They use their beauty as a weapon. And for many of these women, they want to be spoiled; they like having money—and lots of it. Now, we’re sure there are some that are hopeful they will find true love. But we’re betting that many of the models happen to be more interested with their love of money than their dreams of finding “true romance.”</p><p>These beauties and their beasts may get along for a while, but many times over, the relationships don’t last. However, it is lucrative while it lasts.&nbsp;These are 14 Gorgeous Models Who Married Below Their League.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=14-marisa-miller---griffin-guess><strong>14.&nbsp;Marisa Miller - Griffin Guess</strong></h2><p>Music producer Griffin Guess is very talented. His talent makes up for the fact that he looks like the creepy high school kid who lurked in corners of the high school, ogling hot cheerleaders he could never even talk to. But as time went by, his talent and success vaulted him to a status that allowed him the pick of the litter when it comes to beautiful women. In walked <a href=#>Marisa Miller</a>. The supermodel, who has been featured numerous times in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, seemed an odd match until you look at what Guess had to offer Miller. They have been married since 2006.</p><p></p><h2 id=13-christie-brinkley---billy-joel><strong>13. Christie Brinkley - Billy Joel</strong></h2><p>The “Piano Man” has long been<a href=#> Billy Joel</a>’s moniker. And when you hear him sing his songs, you can’t help but swallow his songs like smooth warm liquor. He has big time game behind the keys. However, if you have ever taken a good look at the tiny piano man, he has the face only a fellow street rat could appreciate. Then there was <a href=#>Christie Brinkley</a>. Brinkley was an absolute stunner back in the 1980s. She was on top of her modeling game at the same time the “Piano Man” was rocking his music. The odd ball match lasted a cool 10 years and they had one daughter together before it ended.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=12-adriana-lima---marko-jaric><strong>12. Adriana Lima - Marko Jaric</strong></h2><p>Marko Jaric was a successful NBA player who migrated from Serbia to the US. He played for numerous NBA teams before calling it quits in 2009, heading back to his international roots. Jaric had tremendous success but isn’t one of the stud athletes women flock to. His appearance is highlighted by a large protruding forehead. In 2008, Jaric became engaged to insanely beautiful Brazilian supermodel<a href=#> Adriana Lima</a>. After two children and five years of marriage though, Jaric was rumored to have cheated on his super hot wife and the couple split after five years of marriage. Either way, Lima was WAY out of his league.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=11-heidi-klum---seal><strong>11. Heidi Klum - Seal</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Seal</a> is a singer who hit the stratosphere of his industry when he sang “Kiss From A Rose.” His voice may bring chills down the spines of beautiful women all around the world, but he isn’t much of a looker. Then you have Victoria’s Secret legend <a href=#>Heidi Klum</a>. Klum is gorgeous and a big time supermodel. Klum could easily be considered a solid 9 or 10 in her hay-day. Seal, on the other hand, doesn’t register when it comes to facial features and, of course, love is supposed to be blind. But we’re thinking his bank account and his smooth tunes may have had a lot to do with this relationship. Alas, they ended a pretty solid run of marriage after having 3 kids together.</p><p></p><h2 id=10-paulina-porizkova---ric-ocasek><strong>10. Paulina Porizkova -&nbsp;Ric Ocasek</strong></h2><p>Okay, if anyone has seen pictures of <a href=#>Ric Ocasek</a>, lead singer of the super talented group, The Cars, then they know he looks somewhat like the scary ass freak-girl from The Ring. With his black long mullet and bangs, combined with his long droopy face, it makes Ocasek a pretty ugly dude. Now, his voice is original and the tunes he slung back in the day were pretty impressive, but pair slick Ric with super hottie <a href=#>Paulina Porizkova</a> and you got an odd looking pair. Porizkova was a super hot commodity back in the late 1980s when she appeared on magazine covers galore. She caught Ric’s eye (and about 1 billion other men) and the two ended up together. This one has a happy ending as the pair have been married since 1989 and have two sons together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=9-padma-lakshmi---salman-rushdie><strong>9. Padma Lakshmi -&nbsp;Salman Rushdie&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Author <a href=#>Salman Rushdie</a>&nbsp;looks more like a hobbit from Lord of the Rings than a man who would be married to super beautiful brunette <a href=#>Padma Lakshmi</a>. Lakshmi is the host of “Top Chef.” Prior to her success on television, Lakshmi was just a struggling model walking the runway. Then she met the famous author who was 23 years her elder. Their marriage only lasted 3 years as the differences far outweighed their similarities. To say this was an odd pairing would be an understatement. But once Lakshmi landed on her own two financial feet with her gig at “Top Chef,” it seems she didn’t have as much a need to be married to Rushdie. We’re not just calling this money driven…yeah, we kinda are. Either way, these two didn’t look like they belonged together at all.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-brooke-shields---chris-henchy><strong>8. Brooke Shields -&nbsp;Chris Henchy&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Chris Henchy</a> is a very successful writer/producer in Hollywood. He is also close friends with <a href=#>Will Ferrell</a>. We bring up the Will Ferrell connection because Henchy looks like a slightly older, slightly balder version of Ferrell. <a href=#>Brooke Shields</a> is a model-actress who was sizzling hot through the 1990s. In 2000, the two met on the lot at Warner Bros. Shields was beautiful and Henchy was wealthy and pushing toward Hollywood elite status. It was a match made in heaven and they have been married since 2001 and share two children together.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-milla-jovovich---luc-besson><strong>7. Milla Jovovich -&nbsp;Luc Besson</strong></h2><p>Luc Besson is an old fat Frenchman (we’re not gonna candy coat this one). He also is a very successful director in Hollywood who created such works of art as Leon: The Professional, The Fifth Element and The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc. The latter two films featured one hot young star by the name of <a href=#>Milla Jovovich</a>. Besson was so enamored with the beautiful young star-in-the-making, that he left his second wife for Jovovich. He then put Jovovich in his movies and they got married. That fast and furious marriage lasted just two years and after Jovovich was successful, she walked away. Besson lost his muse while Jovovich gained a career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=6-elle-macpherson---gilles-bensimon><strong>6. Elle Macpherson -&nbsp;Gilles Bensimon</strong></h2><p>Gilles Bensimon is a French fashion photographer and the former International Creative Director at Elle magazine. He is massively influential in the modeling and fashion world. He is also old. When looking at Bensimon, you see grandpa; unless of course you are an up-and-coming model looking to make it in the business. Then maybe you see something else. <a href=#>Elle MacPherson</a> was one of these longing young models back in the 1980s. She hooked up with Bensimon and her career skyrocketed. They were married for 4 years before MacPherson’s career was flourishing and she moved on.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-kristy-hinze---james-h-clark><strong>5. Kristy Hinze -&nbsp;James H. Clark</strong></h2><p>Entrepreneur (another word for really rich dude) <a href=#>James H. Clark</a> settled down with Australian beauty Kristy Hinze in 2009. Hinze is another supermodel who has appeared in Sports Illustrated as well as Victoria’s Secret campaigns. If you’re wondering, James H. Clark is ridiculously rich; as in $1.5 billion rich. And yes, he is over three decades older than Hinze as well! Look, it doesn’t take a mathematician to figure out this equation: science nerd + $1 billion = supermodel. Although we can be jaded at times, we aren’t against true love. But take a look at the pic of these two standing side-by-side and we’ll talk.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-stephanie-seymour---peter-m-brant><strong>4. Stephanie Seymour -&nbsp;Peter M. Brant</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Peter M. Brant</a> is worth over $2 billion. Thought we’d just throw that right out there. Now, Brant was married for many years prior to running into supermodel <a href=#>Stephanie Seymour</a>. In fact, Brant divorced his first wife in 1995 and married Seymour the same year. Ah-hum. Yeah, wealthy businessman ends first marriage and jumps into another marriage with a supermodel, super quick. We are just going to let the facts do the talking&nbsp;and everyone can have their own take. But clearly there is a big difference between the two, physically. We would love to call it true love…but, yeah.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=3-janice-dickinson---albert-gerston><strong>3. Janice Dickinson -&nbsp;Albert Gerston</strong></h2><p>Albert Gerston is an older man, a businessman and someone <a href=#>Janice Dickinson </a>wanted to attach her star to. Back in the day, Dickinson was a supermodel who was on the down slope. These were the 90s and there were younger versions of Dickinson finding success. That is when Dickinson hooked up with Gerston and had two kids over their two years of marriage. Clearly not a match made in heaven, Dickinson got to attach herself to Gerston for a long while with child support. Dickinson, on a side note, has more recently made waves with her claims of being raped by <a href=#>Bill Cosby</a> in her book. We won’t even begin to sift through that mess, but the first ever self-proclaimed “supermodel” clearly wasn’t too enamored with Gerston. Cell phone contracts last longer than her marriage to Gerston did.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-linda-evangelista---gerald-marie><strong>2. Linda Evangelista - Gerald Marie</strong></h2><p>Gerald Marie was another wealthy businessman when he ran into a much younger <a href=#>Linda Evangelista</a>. Marie was head of Elite Modeling Agency in Paris which gave Evangelista good reason to pay attention to him. Evangelista was a beautiful Canadian supermodel. Their age difference didn’t stop their marriage when Evangelista, just 3 years into a budding modeling career, hooked up with Marie. Their marriage lasted 6 years and just three years later, at the age of 33, Evangelista was retired. Evangelista got a big pay day from her divorce with Marie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Evangelista wasn’t done though. After dating a few athletes and actors, she went back to the well and got pregnant with&nbsp;French billionaire <a href=#>Francois-Henri Pinault</a>'s baby and then went to court and asked for $46,000 a month in child support. Pinault is <a href=#>Salma Hayek</a>’s husband these days and they settled out of court on an amount. Needless to say, some of us play the lottery while Evangelista searches out horny and wealthy businessmen. We all have our vices. It certainly has paid off for her unlike the lottery for most of us schmucks.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-claudia-schiffer---matthew-vaughn><strong>1. Claudia Schiffer -&nbsp;Matthew Vaughn&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Matthew Vaughn</a> is a successful film producer and director. He found early success producing <a href=#>Guy Ritchie</a>’s hits Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. He then stepped behind the camera and has directed such movie hits as Kick Ass and X-Men: First Class. Vaughn is badly balding and short, while <a href=#>Claudia Schiffer</a> is a very hot supermodel. In fact, it was just as Vaughn was enjoying his meteoric rise in the film industry in 2000 when he ended up running into Schiffer. Schiffer was on top of the modeling world in the 1990s but as the decade ended, her career was clearly downshifting. The two hooked up with the taller and more attractive Schiffer standing out above her shorter husband. The stars have aligned well for them, however, as they have been happily married for over a decade and are still going strong.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Sources</strong>: <a href=#>wikipedia.org</a>; <a href=#>dailymail.co.uk</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZmpsXZy8s7PEqKysZZ2ksaa40mauoaddoq6zvsiem2aalaG8uHnToZyiql2hsqKz1J5m</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f14-gorgeous-models-who-married-below-their-league.html&text=14%20Gorgeous%20Models%20Who%20Married%20Below%20Their%20League&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f14-gorgeous-models-who-married-below-their-league.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f14-gorgeous-models-who-married-below-their-league.html&title=14%20Gorgeous%20Models%20Who%20Married%20Below%20Their%20League" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f14-gorgeous-models-who-married-below-their-league.html&title=14%20Gorgeous%20Models%20Who%20Married%20Below%20Their%20League" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f14-gorgeous-models-who-married-below-their-league.html&title=14%20Gorgeous%20Models%20Who%20Married%20Below%20Their%20League" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f14-gorgeous-models-who-married-below-their-league.html&description=14%20Gorgeous%20Models%20Who%20Married%20Below%20Their%20League" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./15-platinum-selling-artists-who-never-had-a-number-one-song.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Platinum Selling Artists Who Never Had A Number One Song">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./watch-rob-lowe-as-jfk-in-killing-kennedy.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Watch Rob Lowe As JFK in Killing Kennedy">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
