Many of the 15 actresses you're about to read about were once considered some of the biggest names in the entire industry. Their paycheques for a week of work was more than you've ever earned, they won prestigious awards (including an Academy Award) and were fawned over by seemingly every guy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But if you were hoping to get a glimpse of these starlets, your best bet is going to be on our list or their past classics, and not in an upcoming film or television series. All 15 of them are currently "unemployed", many of whom we're sure are going to stay that way for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Which means if you'd like to see <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lisa Kudrow</a>, for instance, you're probably better off looking&nbsp;for her in Central Perk. Time will tell if younger stars like Beth Behrs is going to be able to overcome her series cancellation. Something that, as you'll read, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Danielle Fishel</a> failed to do. Though <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alyson Hannigan</a> may have also said her goodbyes to Hollywood and she managed to do two very successful shows, so perhaps there is hope? You'll also get to read why <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kathy Griffin</a> thinks she has been blacklisted from the entertainment industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We just hope you won't see too many favorites on our list because there is no denying that these are 15 Hollywood Actresses You Shouldn't Expect To See Anytime Soon.</p><h2 id=courteney-cox><strong>Courteney Cox</strong></h2><p>Whether on Friends or Cougar Town, it's clear that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Courteney Cox</a> is one of the most accomplished females to ever step on to the television screen. Even if Monica can get pretty annoying at times!</p><p>Cox is also part of the hilarious Ace Venture: Pet Detective and the iconic classic horror film Scream - but both films are over a decade old. Now with an excessively large bank account from past success, Cox appears content to kick her feet up and enjoy retirement.</p><p>She has however had a small role in Drunk History (two episodes) which was renewed for a 5th season. In her personal life, Cox married David Arquette in 1999 but they were divorced in 2013. They had one child together.</p><h2 id=danielle-fishel><strong>Danielle Fishel</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There might not be any one actress who is identified&nbsp;with "one role" as Danielle Fishel and Topanga Lawrence (later Topanga Matthews). She was probably a huge part of your childhood with Boy Meets World and was more than happy to re-join the Universe with Girl Meets World which ran from 2014-2017 before being canceled.</p><p>But sadly for Lawrence fans, that's the last they've seen of her and seemingly, that may stay the case. Especially when you consider once the spin-off dies, there's rarely any life left to a franchise. Even sadder, no movie she has appeared in is worth bragging about which is extra disappointing as fans would surely have given her a shot. If you're desperate, she has a non-leading role in National Lampoon's Dorm Daze.</p><h2 id=alyson-hannigan><strong>Alyson Hannigan</strong></h2><p>Many Americans are finding themselves devastated by the news that Netflix has removed How I Met Your Mother. The show had several strong performances, and while Lily could get super annoying, it's hard to fault Hannigan for the writing of the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hannigan may also be a staple in your household for her role as Michelle in the American Pie franchise or Buffy The Vampire Slayer.</p><p>Hannigan's seemingly last role as an actress, at least unless things change, came in 2016 when she appeared in Do You Take This Man alongside Anthony Rapp.</p><h2 id=phoebe-cates><strong>Phoebe Cates</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Phoebe Cates</a> is always going to hold a fond place in many people's hearts for her role in&nbsp;Fast Times at Ridgemont High. She struck gold again two years later when she appeared in&nbsp;Gremlins.</p><p>Nothing she ever could have done was going to live up to those roles, which may have been why she spent much of the&nbsp;90's and 2000's failing to land roles that would allow her to continue as an actress. We wonder if that makes those roles particularly hard for her to watch as a sign as to how promising her career could have been.</p><p>She did, however, appear in&nbsp;The Anniversary Party&nbsp;in 2001 that was written and directed by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Jason Leigh</a> who also starred in&nbsp;Fast Times at Ridgemont High.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=emma-watson><strong>Emma Watson</strong></h2><p>If you plan to check out <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emma Watson</a> anytime soon, it might be on your local tabloid news site and not on the big screen. Following her recent film, The Circle, Watson has kept her acting future completely open. Which might not be the best news for her fans when you consider the film was a huge disappointment - at least according to critics - coming away with a score of 17% on Rotten Tomatoes. Her cameo in&nbsp;This is the End&nbsp;is pretty tremendous though.</p><p>We're sure that even if Watson completely steps away from acting that her role in the Harry Potter franchise will keep her in the public spotlight for the rest of her life.</p><h2 id=eva-mendes><strong>Eva Mendes</strong></h2><p>Some of the actresses on our list were not actively hoping for their film or television career to dry up. But for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eva Mendes</a>, it was an active decision to step away from the industry and focus on being a tremendous mother.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If she wants to step back in, we're sure she'd be able to do it seamlessly when you consider her husband is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan Gosling</a>! The two have been married since 2011 and have two daughters together. Mendes' last film was Lost River in 2014, but she has several classics on her resume such as Hitch and The Other Guys.</p><p>Perhaps once their kids get a little bit older we'll see a re-emergence of Mendes!</p><h2 id=elizabeth-berkley><strong>Elizabeth Berkley</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elizabeth Berkley</a> started becoming a household name when she landed a leading role in&nbsp;Saved By The Bell&nbsp;which ran from 1989-1992. Which means she might still be a pretty active part of your household if you still watch the reruns!</p><p>One of her biggest roles after that was her embracing her sexuality in a major way for the titillating, and often very revealing film,&nbsp;Showgirls. But the back half of Berkley's career has been largely either forgettable or spent with stretches of unemployment. If we wanted to give her some credit, she did make a cameo appearance in&nbsp;New Girl.&nbsp;Though as of now, that cameo is serving as her final appearance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-love-hewitt><strong>Jennifer Love Hewitt</strong></h2><p>If we wanted to talk about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Love Hewitt</a>'s film career, there would, unfortunately, be several examples that we're sure she'd rather have turned down. Such as&nbsp;Jewtopia&nbsp;which came away with a pitiful score of 10%. But that might seem like an Oscar winner in comparison to&nbsp;Truth About Love&nbsp;which didn't impress a single critic. Something tells us that people who love those movies might not exactly be in it for the plot though!</p><p>Hewitt has been far more successful&nbsp;on television, including&nbsp;Ghost Whisperer&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Client List,&nbsp;both lasting for multiple seasons. While there's no television or movie studio out there&nbsp;that's currently going to take a shot with Hewitt, we're sure you wouldn't mind if they tried.</p><h2 id=cameron-diaz><strong>Cameron Diaz</strong></h2><p>In past interviews, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cameron Diaz</a> has stated that her break from Hollywood following her 2014 film&nbsp;Annie&nbsp;is self-inflicted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I just went, 'I can't really say who I am to myself,' which is a hard thing to face up to," but the real reality that many people may agree with is that people no longer seem interested in Cameron Diaz. Critics at the very least haven't given her a passing score with a movie in nearly a decade; including&nbsp;Annie&nbsp;scoring 27%.</p><p>It's possible Diaz may still return to Hollywood, but as of now,&nbsp;she is not signed onto any project and it's hard to see what type of role she can fit into now.</p><h2 id=beth-behrs-and-kat-dennings><strong>Beth Behrs And Kat Dennings</strong></h2><p>Beth Behrs, alongside <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kat Dennings</a>, helped propel&nbsp;2 Broke Girls&nbsp;to 6 seasons and 138 episodes. Which meant that people got plenty used to checking these women out on a regular basis. But perhaps Behrs was being smart with her money and is using the show's cancellation&nbsp;earliest this year as an opportunity to take some time away from the spotlight. If not, you know the headlines are going to have a field day with "Former Star of&nbsp;2 Broke Girls&nbsp;Becomes Broke Girl".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dennings also is at least physically staying out of the spotlight, as her most recent role in&nbsp;Big Mouth&nbsp;is a voice-over. While the show has been a success, it remains to be seen if she'll be able to translate back into the world of physical acting. Her most prominent roles prior to the series were in&nbsp;Thor&nbsp;and&nbsp;40-Year-Old Virgin.</p><h2 id=halle-berry><strong>Halle Berry</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Halle Berry</a> was the best actress in the world, at least as far as the Academy was concerned, back in 2001 when she appeared in Monster's Ball. But her career has been full of duds, with perhaps her most disappointing coming with her most recent effort in Kingsman: The Golden Circle.</p><p>Critics scored the film almost 25% worse in comparison to the 1st one - 74% to 50% on Rotten Tomatoes - and several people have voiced how they felt Berry was one of the weaker parts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perhaps another Kingsman film will pull her career back, especially as the 2nd one did still make a ton of money, but as of now, she has nothing on the horizon and appears to be finished.</p><h2 id=leighton-meester><strong>Leighton Meester</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Leighton Meester</a> may have been on&nbsp;Gossip Girl&nbsp;as one of the lead actresses,&nbsp;but the latest gossip about her is that she is currently unemployed!</p><p>She did have several appearances in the television series&nbsp;Making History&nbsp;in 2017 that while critically well-received, was given the boot after only one season. It's definitely not easy to try and live up to the success of her character Blair Waldorf, something that Meester may be learning the hard way.</p><p>With over 4 million followers on her Instagram account, we're sure there are plenty of people out there who are rooting for some potential project to sign her on for one of the main roles.</p><h2 id=kelly-rowan><strong>Kelly Rowan</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kelly Rowan was one of the biggest stars of the early 2000s for her role of Kirsten Cohen on&nbsp;The O.C.&nbsp;that aired for 4 seasons and 92 episodes.<i> </i>While she also found moderate success with the show&nbsp;Perception, any potential aspirations to become a movie star beyond that have never been realized. But at least she'll always have those fond memories to look back on? Especially because the stability of a successful television show must have been pretty awesome.</p><p>Plus, it's not like she didn't try to make it in the movie industry. Rowan appeared in several made for TV movies including her latest project; a 2016 film titled&nbsp;Tulips In Spring.</p><h2 id=kathy-griffin><strong>Kathy Griffin</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kathy Griffin</a> spent years with most of the control on her show Kathy Griffin: My Life On The D-List. She has also had various cameo roles through the year, often playing herself (or some version of a comic). Perhaps her most memorable coming with her appearance on&nbsp;Seinfeld.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But life isn't going so smoothly for Griffin anymore, especially after she posed for a photo with a bloody imitation <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trump</a> head. Whether you believe her or not, Griffin believes the backlash from the incident has left her blacklisted for her career. But when you consider things weren't exactly going great for Griffin before that, perhaps she is just looking for a reason that'll garner her sympathy.</p><h2 id=lisa-kudrow><strong>Lisa Kudrow</strong></h2><p>You might check out Lisa Kudrow on a daily basis because Netflix conveniently offers Friends. But let's be honest, are there really any other memorable performances that have come from Kudrow?</p><p>Hollywood may not think so, as she currently is left with nothing but free time at least as far as her film and television future looks. It is worth noting that she appeared in Table 19 back in March, but the movie earned under $10 million and was panned by critics. She did, however, lend her voice to The Boss Baby which made close to $500 million at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2dvK242LCmqJxdlrC1vsSsqp6rXa68tnnSoaaupJSjwW6x16mcnKxdqbxuv8SeZJqmqam2rrGMrKaopl8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f15-hollywood-actresses-you-shouldn-t-expect-to-see-anytime-soon.html&text=15%20Hollywood%20Actresses%20You%20Shouldn%27t%20Expect%20To%20See%20Anytime%20Soon&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-hollywood-actresses-you-shouldn-t-expect-to-see-anytime-soon.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-hollywood-actresses-you-shouldn-t-expect-to-see-anytime-soon.html&title=15%20Hollywood%20Actresses%20You%20Shouldn%27t%20Expect%20To%20See%20Anytime%20Soon" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f15-hollywood-actresses-you-shouldn-t-expect-to-see-anytime-soon.html&title=15%20Hollywood%20Actresses%20You%20Shouldn%27t%20Expect%20To%20See%20Anytime%20Soon" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f15-hollywood-actresses-you-shouldn-t-expect-to-see-anytime-soon.html&title=15%20Hollywood%20Actresses%20You%20Shouldn%27t%20Expect%20To%20See%20Anytime%20Soon" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-hollywood-actresses-you-shouldn-t-expect-to-see-anytime-soon.html&description=15%20Hollywood%20Actresses%20You%20Shouldn%27t%20Expect%20To%20See%20Anytime%20Soon" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./amber-gallows-talks-bullet-club-working-w-gfw-njpw-audio-the-latest-impact-in-60-is-hof.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Amber Gallows Talks Bullet Club, Working w/ GFW/NJPW (Audio), The Latest Impact In :60 Is HOF ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./top-10-biggest-contracts-in-mlb-history.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Top 10 Biggest Contracts in MLB History">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
