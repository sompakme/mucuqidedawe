It is no secret that the reality star and entrepreneur has no problem flaunting her wealth and lavish lifestyle on the Internet, unlike some other celebrities who might like to stay a little low key about living the life of the rich and famous. Our society's fascination with celebrity wealth could be why she is one of the most followed celebrities on Instagram, with more than 91 million followers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While some stars who are a little less flashy with their level of wealth&nbsp;such, as <a href=#>Beyonce</a>, <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a>, <a href=#>Ariana Grande</a>, and <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>, have a few million more followers than Kardashian, it’s safe to say Kardashian is still a favorite. Let us not forget that she released an entire book with photographs of herself called Selfie.</p><p>Still, Kardashian might not be able to deny that showing off her most expensive buys on Instagram probably isn’t the best idea after she was reportedly held at gunpoint in Paris after she posted a photo of herself wearing expensive jewelry. She has returned to social media since then, but it looks like she is taking notes from stars like Beyonce and Gomez when it comes to embracing what some say are the most important things in life, like family and loved ones. Considering that we might not see Kardashian sport a Balmain jacket anytime soon on her page, we wanted to take a look back at the top 15 photos that help define Kardashian’s lavish lifestyle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-this-photo-lead-to-her-life-threatening-experience>15. Did This Photo Lead To Her Life-Threatening Experience?</h2><p>Kardashian made headlines after her life was almost taken in a Paris hotel room. But word is that Kardashian showing off her fancy lifestyle and belongings on Instagram and Twitter was a factor in the reality star’s high-profile but very scary incident.</p><p>In one photo she snapped just before masked gunmen swarmed her in the room, she flaunted a diamond ring along with a grill in her mouth. Paris authorities <a href=#>confirmed</a> that the perpetrators were after “possessions that had been seen and noticed via social media.” Kardashian has since returned on social media but hasn’t shown any valuables just yet. Who knows if she ever will again?</p><h2 id=she-never-hesitated-to-support-balmain>14. She Never Hesitated To Support Balmain</h2><p>It wouldn’t be a surprise if, when fans think of Kim Kardashian, they think of luxurious fashion brand&nbsp;Balmain. After all, she probably sports Balmain more than any other celebrity, at least openly anyway. We lost count of how many times she has listed the line as what she is wearing on any given day, but it’s plenty to go around.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Plus, she really validated it when her mini me AKA daughter North West rocked Balmain as well. But we would have never known that’s what the tot was wearing if Kardashian hadn’t written “My little Balmain Ballerina…”</p><h2 id=she-rubs-noses-with-the-former-president>13. She Rubs Noses With The (Former) President</h2><p>Kardashian might have been pretty quiet for the election this time around, but she made it clear that she was Team Obama in his last days in the White House via Instagram.</p><p>She posted a series of photos just before millions said goodbye to <a href=#>Barack Obama</a> as the President of the United States. And even though Obama and Kardashian’s husband<a href=#> Kanye West</a> didn’t have the best history (remember when he called out West after the whole interrupting&nbsp;Taylor Swift at the VMAs thing?), Kardashian seemed to have a few good moments with him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-you-surprised-she-flies-private>12. Are You Surprised She Flies Private?</h2><p>We’re not! What other way would you expect her to get from New York back home to Calabasas, California? Still, while Kardashian is often spotted at the Los Angeles International Airport (which most of us know as LAX), she usually doesn’t hide the fact that she often flies private as well; especially when it comes to showing off her flying style in her Instagram and Twitter photos.</p><p>Interestingly enough, she has taken things a step further and displayed her family’s private jet on several episodes of E!’s Keeping Up With The Kardashians. She also makes it known that her daughter, North West, has enjoyed flying private a time or two, so we can only assume that baby Saint West has had the same luxury.</p><h2 id=she-has-the-most-epic-date-nights-with-a-list-celebrities>11. She Has The Most Epic Date Nights With A-List Celebrities</h2><p>If she rubs elbows with the one and only President Barack Obama, it is not shocking at all that she enjoys a date night here or there with a few other superstars, like after the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Beyonce and <a href=#>Jay Z</a>, <a href=#>Alicia Keys</a> and <a href=#>Swizz Beatz</a>, <a href=#>Sean “P. Diddy” Combs</a> and <a href=#>Cassie</a>, and hip hop mogul <a href=#>Steve Stoute</a> and his wife Lauren Branche, all in one of the photos she posted that showed one of the most epic date nights of all time. We can only imagine the type of conversation they had (and the total amount of net worth that was in the room at the time).</p><h2 id=suicide-doors-are-nothing-more-than-an-accessory>10. Suicide Doors Are Nothing More Than An Accessory</h2><p>Suicide doors? Yes, please! Even though Kardashian is a trendsetter and usually makes her own path instead of following others, she is just one of hundreds of celebrities who take part in the suicide doors option for a luxury car (which is usually just one of a handful sitting in a multi-car garage or a long, swirly driveway).</p><p>And just in case that wasn’t enough for Kardashian to show her lavish lifestyle, she shared a photo of her posing alongside a classic, hot pink Mercedes Benz. She pointed out that she was hanging out at Ernest Hemingway’s house in Cuba.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-stans-for-her-superstar-rapper-husband-all-over-the-world>9. She Stans For Her Superstar Rapper Husband All Over The World</h2><p>A plane ride is nothing for Kim Kardashian, especially when it comes to supporting her husband, Grammy Award winning rapper Kanye West (he has 21 Grammys by the way).</p><p>The two were enjoying a trip to the Kardashian clan’s native country, Armenia, when West decided to throw a surprise concert for his fans. Who does that? Of course West took things up a notch and jumped in a lake while rocking his hottest songs. And Kardashian was right by his side the entire time. But instead of wearing a pair of six-inch heels and skinny jeans, she opted for sweats instead. Of course.</p><h2 id=she-shines-bright-like-a-diamond-in-rome>8. She Shines&nbsp;Bright Like A Diamond In Rome</h2><p>As if Kardashian’s diamond wedding ring didn’t give off enough bling bling here in the States, she took it over to Rome where it got a little more extra shine. Don’t believe us? She said it herself! She posted a photo along with the caption, “My ring shined so bright for our love in Rome while we celebrated our 2 year anniversary in Italy, the country we got married in!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The picture alone says that the ring has more than enough shine for all of us to enjoy. As for West who was also in the picture, let’s just say he let Kardashian takes the award for being the flashy one out of the couple this time around</p><h2 id=a-glam-squad-in-her-bedroom-is-nothing-new>7. A Glam Squad In Her Bedroom Is Nothing New</h2><p>Why travel to get your hair done and makeup beat when the whole glam squad can come to you?</p><p>It’s no secret that the Kardashian family always has a traveling beauty entourage,&nbsp;so why wouldn’t they come straight to her&nbsp;bedroom too? This definitely holds true when Kardashian and her rich and famous family is taping for their reality series Keeping Up With The Kardashians on E! Still, she wouldn’t be the Kim Kardashian that we know and love if she didn’t take time to snap a selfie during the moment. And at least she took the time to shout out her makeup artist and hairstylist who were also in the photo</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-can-laugh-off-the-time-the-late-prince-shaded-her>6. She Can Laugh Off The Time The Late Prince Shaded Her</h2><p>When the loving <a href=#>Prince</a> passed away, the Internet and its trolls dug up one of the throwback clips that Kardashian and Prince had together. Fans might remember the time she was at one of his concerts and he brought her on stage to dance with him. Huge, right?! Right. Well, maybe she was a bit nervous because Prince was not impressed with her skills and booted her off stage. Never one to let us see her sweat (even though she doesn’t mind offering up the ugly cry), Kardashian <a href=#>said</a> she was “starstruck” during the big moment. Hey, at least he knew who she was</p><h2 id=blonde-wig-and-knee-length-fur-coming-right-up>5. Blonde Wig And Knee-Length Fur? Coming Right Up!</h2><p>It’s no secret Kardashian has no problem going head-to-head with PETA over a fur. So were we shocked when she was snapped rocking a huge fur coat along with a bright blonde wig? Absolutely not.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nonetheless, it definitely made headlines as one of Kardashian’s most memorable outfits. After all, she was at Kanye West’s Yeezy Season 3 premiere, so she had to step it up as the lady in his life. Her sister, <a href=#>Khloe Kardashian</a>&nbsp;and mom <a href=#>Kris Jenner</a> opted for wearing a fur too, but it looks like they&nbsp;left their&nbsp;platinum blonde wigs at home. We can only imagine the reaction PETA had with this one</p><h2 id=her-lavish-birthday-party-includes-smooches-from-olivier-rousteing>4. Her Lavish Birthday Party Includes Smooches From Olivier Rousteing</h2><p>Kardashian doesn’t just offer up a good duck lip and puckered-up face for the cameras. She’s been seen smooching iconic fashion designers too. Never mind having a lavish Great Gatsby themed birthday party,&nbsp;the likes of El DeBarge, Charlie Wilson, and <a href=#>David Foster</a>&nbsp;hitting the stage is nothing to scoff at (<a href=#>Jada Pinkett Smith</a> and <a href=#>Will Smith</a> were there too). Kardashian showed just how lavish her recent birthday party was when she got smooches from Olivier Rousteing, the creative director for none other than Balmain. We wouldn’t expect anything less from Kardashian</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-pregnancy-glam-was-the-talk-of-hollywood>3. Her Pregnancy Glam Was The Talk Of Hollywood</h2><p>It might not have always been good talk, but her pregnancy style was definitely a topic of conversation. We can all agree that she certainly stepped up her game when she was carrying Saint, who just turned one back in December. But while toting around the baby bump when she was pregnant with North, Kardashian wasn’t necessarily the go-to woman for pregnancy styles. Just when we started to forget about the floral ensemble she wore to the Met Gala back in 2013, she let us know that it “still fit” in 2015. But hey, it’s Kim K so she can pretty much do whatever she wants.</p><h2 id=let-s-not-forget-kanye-west-s-epic-proposal-that-flooded-our-timelines>2. Let’s Not Forget Kanye West’s Epic Proposal That Flooded Our Timelines</h2><p>Kim Kardashian and Kanye West’s proposal was certainly one to remember. Come on, the guy rented out the Giants stadium in San Francisco just to pop the question in front of her family and closest friends. And he surprised them! What other family can bring dozens of people from Los Angeles and other parts of the country all the way to northern California and still keep it a secret?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s safe to say they fired up the private jet for this one. And their wedding was even crazier. They celebrated in Paris but flew their guests to Italy for the actual ceremony.</p><h2 id=she-sips-tea-with-tennis-great-serena-williams>1. She Sips Tea With Tennis Great Serena Williams</h2><p>Tennis player <a href=#>Serena Williams</a> is a star in her own right, so many fans were surprised when it came out that she and Kardashian are pretty much BFFs. Kardashian has been seen supporting Williams at some of her biggest tennis competitions, but a photo of them simply hanging out could show just how close they really are.</p><p>We can’t say cameras were absent considering the only reason we know they spent the one-on-one time together is because a photo was snapped during their BFF moment. But we can only expect that someone of Kardashian’s caliber would hang out with the rich and famous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFuuc6nnLJnYWp6sbXCrayrnaNiwamt02abnp6Zo7Jut8imZKSZopmutLTImqWsZZyqxba%2ByKisrGWcnrOmv9Oyo55n</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f15-pictures-that-define-kim-kardashian-s-luxurious-lifestyle.html&text=15%20Pictures%20That%20Define%20Kim%20Kardashian%27s%20Luxurious%20Lifestyle&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-pictures-that-define-kim-kardashian-s-luxurious-lifestyle.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-pictures-that-define-kim-kardashian-s-luxurious-lifestyle.html&title=15%20Pictures%20That%20Define%20Kim%20Kardashian%27s%20Luxurious%20Lifestyle" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f15-pictures-that-define-kim-kardashian-s-luxurious-lifestyle.html&title=15%20Pictures%20That%20Define%20Kim%20Kardashian%27s%20Luxurious%20Lifestyle" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f15-pictures-that-define-kim-kardashian-s-luxurious-lifestyle.html&title=15%20Pictures%20That%20Define%20Kim%20Kardashian%27s%20Luxurious%20Lifestyle" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-pictures-that-define-kim-kardashian-s-luxurious-lifestyle.html&description=15%20Pictures%20That%20Define%20Kim%20Kardashian%27s%20Luxurious%20Lifestyle" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./adele-pauses-las-vegas-show-for-matthew-perry-tribute.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Adele Pauses Las Vegas Show for Matthew Perry Tribute">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-love-is-blind-s-micah-lussier-meet-season-4-star.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Love Is Blind's Micah Lussier?
