True to this statement, Kit Harington and Rose Leslie found each other and promised each other a lifetime. Their love story is just as magical and just as clichéd as it gets, but we love it no matter what.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As is true for most of the celebrity couples, these two tried their best to keep their relationship in the down-low, but in vain. Soon, they had to succumb to their fears and announced that they were in love. The paparazzi did the rest of the digging. From the place they own together, to how Kit proposed and, finally, their wedding date, we know it all and we are so glad that it all happened.</p><h2 id=ygritte-met-jon-snow><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>YGRITTE MET JON SNOW</span></h2><p>Ygritte met John...and Kit and Rose fell in love. Initially, the couple denied their relationship, but they couldn't hide it for too long. After coming clean to the media and to their co-workers, Leslie confessed, "We wouldn't flirt in front of other people [and] we thought that nobody knew, but they did. And it doesn't matter; it's fine."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kit-harington-said-he-was-single-and-denied-dating-rumors><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>KIT HARINGTON SAID HE WAS SINGLE AND DENIED DATING RUMORS</span></h2><p>Kit and Rose tried to rubbish any rumors about their relationship, but reporters were adamant. Reporters found the two indulging in some PDA when, earlier that day, Kit kept denying that he and Rose were a couple. Also, it should be added that Kit stated that he was single in the same interview, when he clearly wasn't.</p><h2 id=they-share-the-same-family-line><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>THEY SHARE THE SAME FAMILY LINE</span></h2><p>Kit Harington, aka Christopher Catesby Harington, is related to Rose, in terms of a shared family line. Kit's paternal grandmother, Lavender Cecilia Denny, is related to King Charles II. Rose Leslie is no less of royalty herself; her father is the chieftain of Aberdeenshire's Clan Leslie. The shared bloodline arises because Rose's mother is also related to King Charles II.</p><h2 id=the-real-on-and-off-screen-couple-of-game-of-thrones><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>THE REAL ON-AND-OFF SCREEN COUPLE OF GAME OF THRONES</span></h2><p>This is possibly the cutest fact ever about a celebrity couple! Ygritte and Jon Snow shared their first intimate scene on-screen with each other. Rose and Kit have portrayed a few characters on-screen, but it seems that neither of them has appeared in anything remotely raunchy...until their cave scene in "Game of Thrones Season 3."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=love-under-the-northern-lights><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>LOVE UNDER THE NORTHERN LIGHTS</span></h2><p>It is no surprise that Rose met Kit while shooting Game of Thrones and it is on the set of the show that they fell in love. Kit confirmed in an interview that he had fallen in love with Rose in Iceland while shooting the show under the Northern Lights.</p><h2 id=the-brutal-prank-by-kit-harington><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>THE BRUTAL PRANK BY KIT HARINGTON</span></h2><p>On April Fool's Day, Kit had elaborately planned a surprise for Rose, which surely did not go as planned. Rose was shooting The Good Fight in New York. When she returned to their home, she found a severed head carefully placed in their refrigerator. This horrific sight did not only make Rose cry but labeled Kit as the greatest prankster of the entire crew!</p><h2 id=leslie-thinks-jon-snow-was-a-bad-taste><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>LESLIE THINKS, JON SNOW WAS A 'BAD TASTE'</span></h2><p>The couple was set to attend a birthday party where the theme was 'bad taste'. So, as it had to be when picking out costumes, Leslie made Kit wear the costume of his own character (Jon Snow) and attend the party. Harington claimed that he hated it and that the people at the party thought that he possibly had a sad life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-engagement-announcement><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>THE ENGAGEMENT ANNOUNCEMENT</span></h2><p>Kit and Rose made the sweetest gesture when they announced their engagement publicly. The couple made sure to post an advertisement about their engagement in their local Newspaper, "The Times". The couple included their parents' names.</p><p>The ad read: "The engagement is announced between Kit, younger son of David and Deborah Harington of Worcestershire, and Rose, middle daughter of Sebastian and Candy Leslie of Aberdeenshire."</p><h2 id=was-nicole-kidman-their-matchmaker><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>WAS NICOLE KIDMAN THEIR MATCHMAKER?</span></h2><p>In an interview where Nicole and Kit were in attendance, Kit told the audience about how Leslie had moved in with him. At that very moment, Nicole told Kit to be engaged, rather than just roommates...and Kit was shocked to hear that. This interview was shot somewhere in 2017 and he and Rose got married in 2018, so we can only guess.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=downtown-abbey-does-not-amuse-kit><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>DOWNTOWN ABBEY DOES NOT AMUSE KIT</span></h2><p>"Downtown Abbey" is a part of Leslie's resume and Kit is not a big fan of the show. When the two started dating each other, Kit told a magazine that he has not seen an entire episode of the show He doesn't stand with the message that the show was trying to convey, either.</p><h2 id=the-wedding-invitations-with-jon-snow-stamp><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>THE WEDDING INVITATIONS WITH JON SNOW STAMP</span></h2><p>The Harington- Leslie wedding invitations had the limited edition Jon Snow stamps and the wedding itself was nothing like the weddings in GoT. Leslie, on being asked how her wedding planning was going, had stated that she has not had time to do much because of her busy schedule. But we all know that they just had the most perfect wedding ever.</p><h2 id=wedding-bells><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>WEDDING BELLS</span></h2><p>Kit and Rose got married on June 23rd, 2018, in the perfect Scottish Ceremony. Of course, their co-workers were in attendance, as were their families and close connections, but it was rather a quiet event. The fans could not keep calm as the images of the newlywed couple flooded the Internet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rose-leslie-s-flower-crown-and-wedding-dress-is-deceitful><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>ROSE LESLIE'S FLOWER CROWN AND WEDDING DRESS IS DECEITFUL</span></h2><p>On her wedding day, Rose Leslie wore the most elaborate and intricately designed Eli Saab bridal gown. Even though it looks simple and classy, this royal attire is quite expensive! Apparently, the gown came at a whopping price of $20K, but what else do you expect from a princess, both figuratively and literally?</p><h2 id=from-church-to-castle><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>FROM CHURCH TO CASTLE</span></h2><p>Kit and Rose exchanged their vows in a small local church, which says a lot about the couple. They did not go for grandeur (they went for love instead) and hosted the post-wedding parties at Rose's family home.</p><p>Now, this home is something to talk about, as it is just your neighborhood, 12th-century castle in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, also famously known as Wardhill Castle.</p><h2 id=the-couple-chose-land-rover-defender-over-fancy-cars><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>THE COUPLE CHOSE LAND ROVER DEFENDER OVER FANCY CARS</span></h2><p>The couple took a Land Rover Defender to head to the castle after they exchanged their vows, and that is possibly the cutest thing ever. Obviously, there were throngs of people outside the church, waiting for a glimpse of the newlyweds...so much so that fans were waiting inside bushes just to get one glance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kit-harington-wanted-to-invite-everybody-to-their-wedding><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>KIT HARINGTON WANTED TO INVITE EVERYBODY TO THEIR WEDDING</span></h2><p>In a heartfelt interview, Kit Harington stated that he wanted all of his co-workers to come to his wedding. He said that he had even called up the producers and network, telling them to pause filming for one day, so that every one of the crew members could attend the wedding.</p><h2 id=phobia-or-not-they-are-together><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>PHOBIA OR NOT, THEY ARE TOGETHER</span></h2><p>Kit and Rose both have phobias, but it's a good thing for them that they do not share the same phobias. So, Kit is claustrophobic and cannot be in a crowd...guess shooting for GoT was not a pleasant one for Kit. Also, Kit apparently is afraid of flying in planes and scared of syringes. Yikes! Rose, on the other hand, is scared of spiders and velvet.</p><h2 id=scripts-were-off-limits-for-rose><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>SCRIPTS WERE OFF-LIMITS FOR ROSE</span></h2><p>Due to the secrecy that GoT producers maintained regarding their scripts, Kit was not allowed to read his scripts in front of Rose. Wait, the producers did not force Kit to not read the scripts to Rose! Instead, it was her idea. She wanted anticipation about the show's ending and thus asked Kit to go to the coffee shop while reading it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kit-sang-for-her-on-red-nose-day-and-it-s-on-youtube><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>KIT SANG FOR HER ON RED NOSE DAY-AND IT'S ON YOUTUBE</span></h2><p>For Red Nose Day, a charitable cause, the cast of “Game of Thrones “partnered with Coldplay to create “Game of Thrones: A Musical. “ In this particular musical, Jon Snow performs a parody version of The Troggs, "Wild Thing," renamed as "Wildlings", and he seems to sing it directly to Rose (whose red hair can be seen, partially). Isn't it romantic!</p><h2 id=kit-and-rose-got-schooled-by-the-show-runners><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>KIT AND ROSE GOT SCHOOLED BY THE SHOW-RUNNERS</span></h2><p>The show-runners of GoT- David Benioff and D.B Weiss - had pranked Kit and Rose on two different occasions. Since Kit was a prankster in the set, the duo made sure to send him a false script in which his hair is burnt off, along with parts of his scalp. The script left Kit mortally petrified to shoot that day. For Rose, they just added a false song, because they were aware that Rose hates to sing!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhpaWWknbavs9JmoqKsXZ2us7XNoKuopl2Wu6V50aiqnmWcmsCttcRmm6impGLAqa3RnmSwoaSdeqitzJ5kqJ5dqbWzu82eqmaekaPAcA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f20-things-kit-harington-and-rose-leslie-don-t-share-with-game-of-thrones-fans.html&text=20%20Things%20Kit%20Harington%20And%20Rose%20Leslie%20Don%27t%20Share%20With%20Game%20Of%20Thrones%20Fans&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f20-things-kit-harington-and-rose-leslie-don-t-share-with-game-of-thrones-fans.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f20-things-kit-harington-and-rose-leslie-don-t-share-with-game-of-thrones-fans.html&title=20%20Things%20Kit%20Harington%20And%20Rose%20Leslie%20Don%27t%20Share%20With%20Game%20Of%20Thrones%20Fans" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f20-things-kit-harington-and-rose-leslie-don-t-share-with-game-of-thrones-fans.html&title=20%20Things%20Kit%20Harington%20And%20Rose%20Leslie%20Don%27t%20Share%20With%20Game%20Of%20Thrones%20Fans" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f20-things-kit-harington-and-rose-leslie-don-t-share-with-game-of-thrones-fans.html&title=20%20Things%20Kit%20Harington%20And%20Rose%20Leslie%20Don%27t%20Share%20With%20Game%20Of%20Thrones%20Fans" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f20-things-kit-harington-and-rose-leslie-don-t-share-with-game-of-thrones-fans.html&description=20%20Things%20Kit%20Harington%20And%20Rose%20Leslie%20Don%27t%20Share%20With%20Game%20Of%20Thrones%20Fans" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./behind-shawty-redd-s-murder-charge-pg-3.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Behind Shawty Redds Murder Charge (Pg. 3)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./zulekha-haywood-bio-wiki-age-height-siblings-husband-baby-model-analyst-and-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Zulekha Haywood Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Siblings, Husband, Baby, Model, Analyst, and Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
