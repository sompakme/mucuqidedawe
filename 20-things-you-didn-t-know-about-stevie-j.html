Here we have 20 Things You Didn’t Know About Stevie J, and we are sure that many of the things on this list are going to surprise you. Now, we already know that this music producer is a head-honcho on the hip hop scene. We have seen him work his player status on Love & Hip Hop, as well as help to create and produce some awesome songs. Yet even if you think you know all there is to know, these&nbsp;20 facts will really blow your mind!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here we will learn even more about the people behind Stevie J, as well as what some other artists and celebs have to say about him. As it turns out, Stevie J’s back-and-forth romances and partnerships are not only true, but help make him an incredibly interesting person.&nbsp;He has been in a number of relationships and he has the baby-mamas to prove it. Even so, we can’t overlook the great leaps and bounds that he has made throughout the decades. As a result, here is no doubting that he is definitely a hip hop mogul with staying power!</p><p>So sit back, maybe turn up the tunes, and get ready to educate yourself on the infamous Stevie J.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=20-he-was-one-of-the-bad-boys-behind-honey><strong>20. He Was One of the Bad Boys Behind “Honey”</strong></h2><p>Stevie J helped <a href=#>Mariah Carey</a> out when she released a Bad Boy remix of her hit song “Honey.” While there were other celebs, such as Puff, <a href=#>Mase</a>, and Lox, it was Stevie J rocking it in the background of that music video as well. This was way back in the day (1997 to be exact), and Stevie J was a behind-the-scenes producer for Mariah. That’s a nice musical connection between those two! Plus, they were both pretty young at that time (Stevie J was just in his early twenties) so that was an awesome early gig for him. What a great start!</p><p></p><h2 id=19-he-has-a-generous-heart><strong>19. He Has a Generous Heart</strong></h2><p>Believe it or not, Faith Evans owes Stevie J big-time. A while back, Stevie J gave <a href=#>Faith Evans </a>a loan (a hefty loan) so that she could purchase some new digs in New Jersey. The total amount of the loan? Oh, just $75,000. No big deal, right? Well, apparently there are no hard feelings between Faith and Stevie. In fact, Faith claims that Stevie will always be near and dear to her, not just for helping her out financially but because they have a special bond. It looks like hardcore hip hop producers really do know how to spread some love. Now that’s a story we like to hear about!</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=18-he-is-an-author><strong>18. He is an Author</strong></h2><p>At least, somewhat. It turns out that besides producing and making it big on the music scene, Stevie J also puts pen to paper. He got in touch with his inner writer and started working on a book called Taking One for the Team. The premise of the book is pretty much explained by its title. It was an opportunity for Stevie J to write about different&nbsp;music producers and people in the hip hop industry. He claims that he wants to call attention to the struggles, perspectives, and lifestyle of those on the scene. At the very least, given the numerous celebrities that Stevie has interacted with, I am sure it is worth a read.</p><p></p><h2 id=17-he-loves-marilyn-monroe><strong>17. He Loves Marilyn Monroe</strong></h2><p>A headline like that needs to be explained. While doing an interview,&nbsp;Stevie J was asked about some dreamy romantic situations. And of course the name of <a href=#>Marilyn Monroe</a> would come up. Who wouldn’t want to have a romantic encounter with her? The exact question was who would be Stevie J’s dream hookup. Besides mentioning Marilyn Monroe, Stevie J also expressed some interest in <a href=#>Dita von Teese</a> (in case you don’t know, she is a professional burlesque dancer). At least Stevie J has good taste! He knows what he likes and he is not afraid to go after it and clearly that doesn't just mean in regards to music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=16-his-romantic-past-is-interesting><strong>16. His Romantic Past is Interesting</strong></h2><p>Just how much do you know about Stevie J’s past loves? Many people now know him from the TV series Love & Hip Hop, but he was dating and working the scene way before that. As it turns out, Stevie J was in a long-term relationship with Alex Martin, who is the daughter of none other than <a href=#>Whoopi Goldberg</a>. Alex and Stevie J were together for 6 years, and they were even engaged back in 2007. Unfortunately, the couple called it quits before tying the knot. Another romantic connection for Stevie J is <a href=#>Joseline Hernandez</a>, whom Stevie J dated back when she was under the radar.</p><p></p><h2 id=15-he-has-an-eye-and-ear-for-talent><strong>15. He Has an Eye and Ear for Talent</strong></h2><p>Do not underestimate Stevie J. While it is no secret that he has an affinity for women, he also really does know how to spot their talents. And we mean that in an entirely clean way. For instance, Stevie J has an eye and an ear for seeking out awesome talent throughout the hip hop industry. He was involved with Joseline Hernandez before she made it to the big time, and he also worked with <a href=#>Jazmine Sullivan </a>back before she was a breakout star. So even if you hate him, it is clear that he really does know what he’s doing! After all, we are talking about a guy who worked with Mariah Carey.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=14-he-sets-his-sights-high><strong>14. He Sets His Sights High</strong></h2><p>Really high. He was in an interview in 2008 and was asked about his 5-year plan. His answer? He saw himself performing in Las Vegas (of course), hitting it big-time with the party crowd and having a good time. Performing live was definitely at the top of his list, but is that shocking given his passion for music? Stevie J wanted to hone his talents and show them off for audiences. He likened his plans to <a href=#>Frank Sinatra</a> or Sammie Davis-level success…playing on instruments, singing, sold-out audiences. Hey, always dream big.</p><p>One thing that may have been surprising? Another one of his hopes is was to be constructing cool new hotels and resorts in Las Vegas.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=13-his-love-life-is-no-joke><strong>13. His Love&nbsp;Life is No Joke</strong></h2><p>Maybe you have watched Love & Hip Hop and thought that a lot of the stuff was staged. It could be, but probably not. According to Che Mack (who used to be on the show), she was actually asked to get busy with Stevie J under the sheets in order to drive up ratings for the show. Really? She says “yes!” While she did not say that it was Stevie J who made the recommendations, she did mention that “other producers” were urging her to go for it in order to boost the series. Given Stevie J’s romantic past, we really don’t doubt this one!</p><p></p><h2 id=12-he-is-a-smarty-pants><strong>12. He is a Smarty-Pants</strong></h2><p>At least that is what Joseline Hernandez says. Sure, Stevie J helped her to catapult her career to the big-time, but apparently she says that what most attracted her to the music producer was his wit and smarts. He definitely has some decent insider knowledge on the industry. After all, he has been doing this for years! According to Hernandez, Stevie’s brain is “genius” and the main reason why she continues to work with him. We are sure that Stevie J is well-schooled on the music scene and knows how to wheel and deal. Good for him, and good for his endeavors!</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=11-he-is-a-family-man><strong>11. He is a Family Man</strong></h2><p>Sure, Stevie J already has a number of children (six to be exact), but he really does want to expand his family. That may be a bit difficult, considering his tumultuous past with various women but who knows? Maybe being open and honest about it will make having more kids easier. Either way, one thing that Stevie J has not been shy around the idea of pregnancy. While some can think that bigger families with multiple partners can make being a parent hard, Stevie J is allegedly a great Father.&nbsp;We just hope that he keeps conversations about his sperm count and “beefcake” out of the earshot of his offspring.</p><p></p><h2 id=10-he-has-a-soft-spot><strong>10. He Has a Soft Spot</strong></h2><p>You may not equate Stevie J with love songs at first glance, but you would be wrong. It turns out that Stevie J was actually behind a number of romantic songs and hip hop ballads. For example, “Falling for You” was sung by <a href=#>Tamia</a>, but was written by Stevie J. The same goes for “Can’t Let Her Go” by Boys II Men and “Only You” by 112. As a matter of fact, Stevie J has fond memories and happy feelings about “Only You,” counting it as one of his all-time favorite songs to work on. He really can be a total sweetheart!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=9-he-lost-his-virginity-at-17-to-a-teacher><strong>9. He&nbsp;Lost His Virginity At 17 To A Teacher</strong></h2><p>It is at least clear that he was always looking for some action! Stevie J himself once said in an interview that he lost his virginity when he was 17 years old. Not only that, but the first person he had sex with was a substitute teacher at his school! Hopefully that did not happen during school hours, and we are not sure what happened to said teacher. Still, Stevie J actually has good memories of the encounter. We don’t need to repeat his words here (it’s Stevie J, what do you expect?) but you can probably guess. There is no doubt that he was always able to attract the ladies!</p><p></p><h2 id=8-he-has-really-played-the-field><strong>8. He Has Really Played the Field</strong></h2><p>Not only does Stevie J have quite a number of kids (at least, we think that six children is a lot), but his children have different mothers. Moreover, some of his children are the same age! You know what that means…Stevie J was sleeping around with multiple women at the same time. And the music producer is totally cool with showing that off. He even made a showy appearance at a high-profile party in which he had one pregnant woman on each arm. Yep, he was the baby-daddy for both of those women. Surprisingly, they were both okay with showing up at a party on Stevie J’s arm.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-he-is-the-man-behind-an-eve-song><strong>7. He is the Man Behind an Eve Song</strong></h2><p>And that news comes from Eve herself. The female rapper said that her song “Gotta Man” is actually about Stevie J himself. She claimed that the music producer was her very first true love, so the song is totally dedicated to him. Sounds nice in theory. The song is totally lovey-dovey, in a hip hop kind of way and it probably pulls at Stevie J’s heartstrings, even if the two have had some up's and downs. It is kind of a shame that such an intimate and meaningful song was sung by a woman who didn’t have a more serious relationship with Stevie J. At least, we don’t think she ever got pregnant by Stevie J!</p><p></p><h2 id=6-he-is-musically-gifted><strong>6. He is Musically Gifted</strong></h2><p>Yes, we already know that, but let’s look a little deeper here. Sure, Stevie J is a famous music producer and the guy behind a lot of popular hits. Yet many people might not realize that he is multi-talented. He can pen some awesome lyrics, he can produce top-notch songs for people like Mariah Carey and Joseline Hernandez, and he is never on to shy away from picking up a new instrument. He has dabbled in piano, guitar, violin, saxophone…there really is nothing he won’t touch. That kind of musicality and versatility is admirable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=5-he-got-told-off-by-his-kids><strong>5. He Got Told Off by His Kids</strong></h2><p>Yep, in case you were wondering whether or not his children have seen Love & Hip Hop, they have. Or at least, some of his daughters have. After witnessing his shenanigans on the show, Stevie J’s own daughters were disgusted with him. They even told him not to contact them, but that they would give him a call when they wanted to. They were pretty fed up with how Stevie J treated women and spoke on the TV series, and that is a totally valid feeling, if you look at his behaviour. Plus, his daughters were pretty young – just 14 and 17 years old at the time. So for them to see their dad on the show like that…well, that’s not going to lead to some positive family conversations.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=4-he-is-involved-in-various-circles><strong>4. He is Involved in Various Circles</strong></h2><p>Of friends, we mean. Stevie J may be a mainstay on the hip hop stage, or in the music world in general, but he has delved into other crowds of people. For instance, one of his best friends is actually Danny Way, who is a professional skateboarder. It may seem like a strange pairing for a friendship, but why not? We are not ones to deny positive friendships. All corniness aside, Danny and Stevie J actually got together to work on a film together. The movie was a sort of documentary about Danny Way, and his pal Stevie J was asked to produce the musical soundtrack. Sweet!</p><p></p><h2 id=3-he-has-resting-b---h-face><strong>3. He Has Resting B---h Face</strong></h2><p>Let us explain. Stevie J once spoke in an interview about how his facial expressions are often hyperactive and really pronounced, and you can see this on Love & Hip Hop. Well, apparently he isn’t really acting when it comes to his face. He is one of those people whose emotions truly show through facial expressions. So, a lot of times, people can guess what Stevie J is feeling just from looking at him. While he doesn’t always have Resting B---h Face, he has a number of “Stevie J Faces” which do make him quite a character!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=2-he-is-still-an-active-hitman><strong>2. He is Still an Active Hitman</strong></h2><p>Stevie J first branched out as part of the Hitmen hip hop roster. He has come a long way since he first burst onto the scene, but he is still a Hitman at heart! In fact, the group is still going strong, with the most recent addition being <a href=#>Kanye West</a>. The Hitmen are pulling together to work on a new album alongside <a href=#>Sean “Diddy” Combs</a>, entitled Money Making Mitch. Hip hop and Stevie J fans are going to want to keep an eye out for that! Along with Kanye West and Stevie J, the other hitmen will be featured, including Chucky Thompson, D-Dot, Mario Winans, Angelettie, and Nashiem Myrick.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-he-always-has-something-up-his-sleeve><strong>1. He Always Has Something up His Sleeve</strong></h2><p>We never really know what to expect from Stevie J. We just keep finding ourselves wondering what is going to be the next crazy thing to come out of his mouth! As a matter of fact, he wanted to be the “bad guy” in Love & Hip Hop. The creators asked him to join in as the “star of the show,” but Stevie J had different plans. Mission accomplished? We know that he has a womanizer side to him, but evidently, he can be a big teddy bear too.
