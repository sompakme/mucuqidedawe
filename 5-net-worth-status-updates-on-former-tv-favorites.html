But where are they now and are they still making as good a living?</p><h2 id=kerri-russell>Kerri Russell</h2><p>Wikimedia Commons</p><p>Like many of her peers (Ryan Gosling and <a href=#>Britney Spears</a> to name a few) Keri Russell started her acting career on the All-New Mickey Mouse Club when she was 15-years-old. Just a year later, she booked a role in her first major movie, Honey, I Blew Up the Kids. She went on to appear on Boy Meets World, Married... with Children and in a Bon Jovi music video. She got her breakthrough role when she was 22-years-old - the title role in the WB series, Felicity, for which she went onto win an Emmy Award. Following Felicity, Keri did a lot of stage acting, landed a brand endorsement deal with CoverGirl cosmetics and appeared in numerous movies like <a href=#>Adam Sandler's</a> Bedtime Stories and Waitress. In 2013, she started playing Elizabeth Jennings in FX's The Americans, which ran for six seasons, ending in 2018. <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a> reported that Keri made $100,000 per episode for her staring role on the show. Most recently, she appeared in Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker. According to <a href=#>Town & Country</a>, Kerri currently lives in Brooklyn Heights with her partner and former The Americans co-star Matthew Rhys, her three children and has an estimated net worth of $12 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=james-van-der-beek>James Van Der Beek</h2><p>When he was only 20, James Van Der Beek landed the life changing role of Dawson Leary on Dawson's Creek. The show ran for six seasons and ended in 2004. Even though the show was quite popular and James Van Der Beek was a household name, he claims that the show "paid almost nothing" due to the fact that he signed a "bad contract", according to<a href=#> Showbiz Cheat Sheet</a>. Despite this and the fact that Van Der Beek has said that there was no residual money from Dawson's Creek and that his money from the show ran out years ago, he still has an estimated net worth of $8 million. This is thanks to multiple television and movie credits such as Varsity Blues, Scary Movie, Ugly Betty, How I Met Your Mother, Don't Trust the B-- In Apartment 23 and What Would Diplo Do, which he stared in and created. He also competed on <a href=#>Dancing with the Stars</a> in 2019. He is the father of five children and recently traded in his LA life for a large property in Austin, Texas that has a barn and several cabins.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mayim-bialik>Mayim Bialik</h2><p>Mayim Bialik got her start at just 12-years-old playing Bette Midler's character as a child in the movie Beaches.

According to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, she appeared in 203 episodes and made $200,000 an episode (that's roughly $4.5 million per season). That is until the show's final two seasons when the five main stars agreed to take a pay cut so that Mayim's salary could go up to $450,000 per episode, roughly $10 million a season. Not only has Mayim had a busy acting career, but she is also a neuroscientist, a published author and the co-founder of a non-profit, all of which contribute to her estimated net worth of $25 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>7 Richest Child Stars Of All Time</a></span></p><h2 id=christine-lakin>Christine Lakin</h2><p>While her name may not be as recognizable as the others on the list, you certainly know Christine Lakin as Alicia (Al) Lambert from Step By Step.
