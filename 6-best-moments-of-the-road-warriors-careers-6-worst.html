History is fuzzy on whether this was the first instance of Hawk working this particular spot, but it certainly was one of the highest profile, most momentous early iterations of it. The moment got over well enough that it became a staple with Hawk in particular taking piledrivers from a range of opponents, up to including a performance opposite Kane in 2003, and not letting one of the most universally devastating moves in wrestling slow him down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=worst-the-scaffold-match-is-hard-to-watch><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Worst: The Scaffold Match Is Hard To Watch</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Jim-Cornette-Scaffold-Match-Injury.jpg><p>Starrcade 1986 saw The Road Warriors take a starring role as they faced off with The Midnight Express in a Scaffold Match.

Matters grew worse when Jim Cornette took the ugliest bump off, falling from a great height. His kayfabe body bodyguard, Big Bubba Rogers, was supposed to catch him, but was out of position, leading to a legit gruesome knee injury for the manager.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=best-the-1987-war-games><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Best: The 1987 War Games</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/road-warriors-war-games.jpg><p>The Four Horsemen's mid-to-late 1980s shenanigans all came to a head for the first time in 1987 with the inaugural WarGames match, and Ric Flair and company had quite the team opposing them. Along with Dusty Rhodes and <a href=#>wrestling legend Nikita Koloff</a>, The Road Warriors <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">entered the fray</a>, bringing their manager Paul Ellering (a former wrestler himself) into the cage as the fifth member of the team. The good guys came out on top in this first outing, and the Road Warriors took part in 15 WarGames matches over the course of their career together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=worst-hawk-amp-animal-rediscover-rocco-the-dummy><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Worst: Hawk & Animal Rediscover Rocco The Dummy</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/road-warriors-rocco.jpeg><p>Despite a rename to the admittedly less cool Legion of Doom, Hawk and Animal seemed poised for greatness in WWE upon arriving in 1990. While they enjoyed a 165-day reign with the World Tag Team Championship, they also suffered the indignity of Rocco. Presented as Hawk and Animal’s toy from childhood, Rocco was a ventriloquist dummy that Ellering carried around to further inspire them to win wrestling matches for some reason.

After all, they were way too cool to boo. That all changed in 1988, when Sting filled in for Dusty Rhodes in a defense of their NWA World Six-Man Tag Team Championship.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>8 Times Sting Got Betrayed In Pro Wrestling, Explained</a></span></p><p>Annoyed that Rhodes was unable to defend the belts with them, Hawk and Animal ended up turning on their replacement tag team partner.

With the new millennium a few years away, Hawk and Animal — once again known as the Legion of Doom — changed with the times, becoming LOD 2000. Managed by Sunny (at least for a time), this new and <a href=#>ultimately disappointing</a> version of Legion of Doom had shiny entrance gear that seemed more Rollerball than Mad Max.</p><h2 id=best-stabbing-dusty-rhodes-in-the-face><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Best: Stabbing Dusty Rhodes In The Face</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/the-road-warriors-make-dusty-rhodes-bleed-in-wcw.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now heels in WCW, The Road Warriors weren’t satisfied just picking on Dusty’s friend, Sting — they of course had to go after “The American Dream” himself. As a result, a segment aired in 1988 featuring Hawk and Animal not only attacking Dusty Rhodes but stabbing him in the face with one of their own shoulder pad spikes, making their former tag team partner a bloody mess. Besides being brutal in the classic NWA tradition, it proved controversial, resulting in Rhodes — who was also the booker — <a href=#>getting fired from WCW</a> due to a newly imposed “no blood” policy.</p><h2 id=worst-hawk-jumps-off-the-titantron><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Worst: Hawk Jumps Off The TitanTron</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hawk-alcholism-cropped.jpg><p>The weird indignities of The Legion of Doom’s Attitude Era run certainly make Rocco the dummy pale in comparison. By 1998, WWE was running a story where Hawk’s real-life alcoholism was proving a liability to the LOD’s tag team success — and it was all enabled by their new young protege, Puke (later known as Droz). The nadir of this angle had a suicidal <a href=#>Hawk climbing to the top of the TitanTron on Raw and falling off the set</a>, which proved to be one of the more regrettable moments of the Attitude Era as well as Hawk and Animal’s career together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=best-teaming-with-ahmed-johnson><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Best: Teaming With Ahmed Johnson</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/legion-of-doom-ahmed-johnson-wrestlemania.jpg><p>Hawk and Animal’s WWE run during the Attitude Era wasn’t all bad, however. In early 1997, the LOD made their return to WWE and had a big match set up for WrestleMania 13. At ‘Mania, they teamed with Ahmed Johnson to take on Johnson’s enemies, The Nation of Domination, in a Chicago Street Fight.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Things Fans Forget About The Legion Of Doom's WWE Careers</a></span></p><p>The match itself was a fun, wild brawl worthy of the Legion of Doom’s participation, but it also featured a particularly awesome moment during the entrance as Ahmed Johnson came out with LOD wearing his own set of spiked shoulder pads to match Hawk and Animal. Needless to say, it made for a very cool image.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=worst-animal-rsquo-s-underwhelming-wcw-return><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Worst: Animal’s Underwhelming WCW Return</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/road-warrior-animal-unmasked-1.jpg><p>While much of The Road Warriors’ best work happened in WCW, it wasn’t always great. In 2001, Hawk and Animal seemed to go their separate ways, with Hawk dealing with personal and health problems while Animal returned to WCW at the Sin pay-per-view. The main event was a four-way match for the WCW World Title, with Animal among the three as a mystery competitor. The match is most famous for Sid Vicious <a href=#>breaking his leg live on PPV</a>, with Animal’s appearance happening shortly after and happening to a depressingly muted response.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=best-canadian-stampede><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Best: Canadian Stampede</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Hart-Foundation-v-Goldust-Shamrock-Austin--LOD-Canadian-Stampede-1997-Cropped.jpg><p>Pro wrestling has enjoyed some classic crowds in its time, but no grouping of fans have been quite as vocal and wild as the Calgary crowd at <a href=#>the forgotten gem WWE pay-per-view In Your House 16: Canadian Stampede</a>. In the main event of that show, The Hart Foundation — heels in the US but heroes in Canada — took on a randomly thrown together American team that included Steve Austin, Goldust, Ken Shamrock, and the Legion of Doom. It’s yet another wild brawl, but one made even more exciting by the white-hot crowd.</p><h2 id=worst-road-warrior-animal-39-s-partnership-with-heidenreich><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Worst: Road Warrior Animal's Partnership With Heidenreich</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LOD-2005-heidenreich-animal-road-warriors-legion-of-doom.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tragically, Hawk suffered a fatal heart attack in October 2003 at the age of 46. This left Animal to continue solo, but he ended up finding a new partner upon returning to WWE in 2005. As a result, a new version of the Legion of Doom was born, with Animal joined by Heidenreich. While LOD 2005 enjoyed a three-month run with the WWE Tag Team Championship, the tag team was deemed a disappointment and a shadow of its former self, as Animal was past his prime and Heidenreich was considered a weak in-ring competitor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmeSmsC1ecyopJ6mpKh6s7vAnWSwmaKntrC%2B0maamqqVmr%2B0edaoqaysXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f6-best-moments-of-the-road-warriors-careers-6-worst.html&text=6%20Best%20Moments%20Of%20The%20Road%20Warriors%27%20Careers%20%28%26amp%3b%206%20Worst%29&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f6-best-moments-of-the-road-warriors-careers-6-worst.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f6-best-moments-of-the-road-warriors-careers-6-worst.html&title=6%20Best%20Moments%20Of%20The%20Road%20Warriors%27%20Careers%20%28%26amp%3b%206%20Worst%29" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f6-best-moments-of-the-road-warriors-careers-6-worst.html&title=6%20Best%20Moments%20Of%20The%20Road%20Warriors%27%20Careers%20%28%26amp%3b%206%20Worst%29" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f6-best-moments-of-the-road-warriors-careers-6-worst.html&title=6%20Best%20Moments%20Of%20The%20Road%20Warriors%27%20Careers%20%28%26amp%3b%206%20Worst%29" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f6-best-moments-of-the-road-warriors-careers-6-worst.html&description=6%20Best%20Moments%20Of%20The%20Road%20Warriors%27%20Careers%20%28%26amp%3b%206%20Worst%29" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./everything-kyle-richards-and-morgan-wade-have-said-about-each-other.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Everything Kyle Richards and Morgan Wade Have Said About Each Other">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./10-of-the-world-s-most-famous-schizophrenics.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Of The World's Most Famous Schizophrenics">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
