What we have heard about it though is pretty bad. You rarely hear good things about Scientology because they are too busy putting out fires left by celebrities who have run from the religion like a demon was chasing them. You would think that with so many big names in the religion that more people would be drawn to it but many people fear what really goes on behind closed doors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It also doesn’t help that celebrities such as Leah Remini have been bashing the religion since she left it and has no problem throwing Tom Cruise under the bus either. She started with a book about the religion, but her opinion became so popular that she even has a show about it called Scientology and the Aftermath. Tom Cruise is pretty much the most prevalent Scientologist in Hollywood. When you think about the religion, you automatically think of Cruise. He’s the golden boy of Scientology and he probably wouldn’t even recognize his life if he ever left it. His first wife, Mimi Rogers, was the one who introduced him to the lifestyle and he’s never looked back. Being a part of the organized religion has certainly cost him a couple of ex-wives and even hurt his career a time or two. It seems the more we hear about Scientology, the more controversy it creates. Let’s take a look at the connections that Tom Cruise has in Scientology.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-first-wife-was-on-board><strong>His First Wife&nbsp;Was On Board</strong></h2><p>Tom Cruise wasn’t always a famous celebrity and he wasn’t always a Scientologist. Just as his career in Hollywood was starting out, he met Mimi Rogers and that was way back in the '80s. Rogers has always been a Scientologist thanks to her father and she was the one that brought him into the fold. She wouldn’t realize that her own religion would try to take down their relationship, however, but that’s exactly what happened. We’re not sure what Scientology has against Tom’s wives, but they have gotten rid of a few of them. We’re not sure why they would ruin Rogers and Cruise since they were both devoted members. A former executive for the Church of Scientology, Mark “Marty” Rathbun said he had a hand in it.</p><p><strong>“I participated in the Mimi divorce and in the Nic divorce.</strong></p><p>Both women got cold on Miscavige. He was integral to the breakup of the marriages.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=john-travolta-is-another-major-member><strong>John Travolta Is Another Major Member</strong></h2><p>Like Tom Cruise, John Travolta found his way into the organized religion because he thought it was a “beautiful religion.” Tom and John are close friends and Travolta is another major player in the religion. Part of the religion teaches its members to go out in the world and help people heal their bodies by “assisting” them. It all sounds very innocent until you see it in action and then it’s just creepy. Travolta found himself in a situation where he could help someone who broke a leg and he went to work.</p><p><strong>"I was in Shanghai recently at a work event and the Master of Ceremonies' best friend had recently gotten into a car wreck.&nbsp;He had broken his ankle and was in constant pain. I asked him permission to do some Scientology assists and he said, 'Okay, sure.'"</strong></p><p>Travolta said he helped the man get better but who knows what actually happened.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tom-cruise-almost-got-nicole-kidman-on-board><strong>Tom Cruise Almost Got Nicole Kidman On Board</strong></h2><p>Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman seemed like a match made in Hollywood history when they met on the set of Days of Thunder. These two were smoking hot together. They had been together for many years before they announced their plans to divorce. Many people believed that Kidman got sick of the religion because she was a devout Catholic and the whole thing never sat well with her. The former executive of the Church of Scientology already mentioned how he was involved in getting rid of Cruise’s first two marriages.</p><p><strong>Mark Rathbun claimed they had tapped Kidman’s phone and even tried to destroy the relationship she had with her children.</strong></p><p>The religion wanted them to turn away from their mother. Both of Cruise and Kidman’s children are active members of the religion because they were convinced to follow in their father's religious path.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tom-cruise-almost-convinced-katie-holmes><strong>Tom Cruise Almost Convinced Katie Holmes&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>At least at the beginning of their relationship, Katie Holmes was a very devoted partner to Tom Cruise. Despite the kooky rumors surrounding Scientology, she started to take classes at the church so that she could be more involved in Cruise’s passion. It wasn’t long before we saw Scientology minions following her around wherever she went.</p><p><strong>The Church of Scientology didn’t have a chance to break up this marriage, however, because when Holmes realized what her child would grow up in, she left in the middle of the night with her daughter and never looked back.</strong></p><p>Holmes was in an advantageous position since both her parents are lawyers and helped their daughter get out of a marriage with full custody of their daughter. Many people believe that the only reason Cruise let go of Holmes and their child so easily is because Holmes agreed to stay quiet about everything she knew about Scientology.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=erika-christensen-went-all-in><strong>Erika Christensen Went All In</strong></h2><p>It is rumored that Erika Christensen got involved in Scientology because of Tom Cruise. She certainly hasn’t experienced the same kind of fame as John Travolta or Tom Cruise, that’s for sure, so maybe Scientology should be helping her out a little more. She is probably most known for her role as the hot, psychotic stalker in the movie Swimfan. Her parents are also Scientologists and she hopes that her children will too follow the same path.</p><p><strong>“I would expose to them, like, this is what I do, which is how my parents did it because my parents are Scientologists. When I was like seven, they did like this demonstration. There is this thing in Scientology, it’s a study method to demonstrate things out.”</strong></p><p>We’ll pass on the demonstration.</p><h2 id=bella-and-connor-cruise-were-brought-in-by-their-father><strong>Bella And Connor Cruise Were Brought In By Their Father</strong></h2><p>Nicole Kidman didn’t slip away as well as Katie Holmes did because she left her children behind in a religion that sounds more and more like a cult every day. Connor and Bella Cruise are the adopted children of Tom and Nicole and&nbsp;she, unfortunately, stayed in the marriage long enough for the kids to become very involved in the church. They have not left Scientology and it’s unlikely that they ever will as long as Tom’s involved.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>There are rumors that the children are estranged from their mother because she left Scientology.</strong></p><p>It’s rumored that Nicole wasn’t invited to Bella’s wedding and according to Leah Remini, Bella does not want to talk to Nicole. "Not if I have a choice," Bella said.</p><h2 id=leah-remini-thinks-tom-has-a-huge-influence><strong>Leah Remini Thinks Tom Has A Huge Influence</strong></h2><p>Leah Remini and Tom Cruise used to be friends at one point. She was also someone that was part of the organization, but she fled it because of the brainwashing the religion is. She has stated that there is a lot of hypocrisy in regard to Cruise in the religion because he doesn’t always have to follow the rules like everyone else. Since she left, she has had no problem with throwing Cruise under the bus every chance she can get, so we imagine that their friendship probably hasn’t lasted. She stated in one interview with Fox News that Tom Cruise has the power to end Scientology forever.</p><p><strong>“He could end this.”</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His fame has a lot to do with what’s holding the religion together and that it pushes the idea that Cruise is “clearing the planet, is changing the planet.” Remini is also good friends with Jennifer Lopez whose dad was a Scientologist for 30 years.</p><h2 id=nazanin-boniadi-was-to-be-tom-s-new-girl><strong>Nazanin Boniadi Was To Be Tom’s New Girl</strong></h2><p>What a stunner. We’re sure Tom Cruise wouldn’t have minded being set up with this beauty. She was in&nbsp;Homeland&nbsp;and was also a Scientologist at one point.</p><p><strong>Apparently, the church handpicked her to be Tom Cruise’s next girlfriend. She’s certainly pretty enough and it probably would have helped her career a little bit.</strong></p><p>It definitely helped Katie Holmes in that department, though we doubt she feels it was worth it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Boniadi ended up getting on the wrong side of the Scientology leader, Miscavige, and left the church before her union with Cruise could happen. She left because she was being punished for insubordination. We’re not sure what the punishment was, but she wasn’t having any part of it. She left the church and never looked back. She’s probably better off for it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=juliette-lewis-speaks-out-about-her-problems><strong>Juliette Lewis Speaks Out About&nbsp;Her Problems&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Like Tom Cruise, Juliette Lewis has also spoken out about pharmaceutical drugs and the harm that they can cause. Lewis has been in the industry since she was a kid in the National Lampoon Christmas Vacation movies. We had no idea she was a second-generation Scientologist. That is until she went public with her opinions on drugs. When she was younger, Lewis claims to have been a pot smoker who moved quickly to using coke. She claims that it was Scientology that helped her live a drug-free life.</p><p><strong>“Scientology keeps me rooted and grounded — it's been an amazing force in my life.”</strong></p><p>She has gone so far as to say that the big pharmaceutical companies are controlling the media. She claims that’s why Scientology has such a bad rap.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-king-s-daughter-bailed-as-well><strong>The King’s Daughter Bailed As Well</strong></h2><p>We have to wonder what Tom Cruise thinks when a ton of the famous members jump ship from his "beautiful" religion. Does he ever have doubts that he may be involved in something that isn’t good for him and his children? Lisa Marie Presley was also a member of the church and when she bailed out in 2012, she wrote a song about it. She explained where she got the inspiration for the song So Long.</p><p><strong>"There was a point in my life where no one would ever tell me anything bad. No one was telling me what was happening or what was going on, really. So, I had a very obscure and actually completely blocked view of reality for a very long time.</strong></p><p>So, when I got rid of all these nuts in my life and these, whatever, they're crazy criminal people, away, that I was like, okay, I'm going to go find out what's really going on out there."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=director-paul-haggis-wants-tom-to-answer-some-questions><strong>Director Paul Haggis Wants Tom To Answer Some Questions</strong></h2><p>Director Paul Haggis is yet another famous person that left Scientology and has a lot of bad things to say about the organization. Most specifically, he wants to know why the press never questions Tom Cruise harshly about his religion when doing interviews. Apparently, Tom’s P.R. team generally avoids the tough question-askers and will even ban questions about relationships or Scientology. But Paul Haggis doesn’t think that’s good enough.</p><p><strong>“But I don’t know how journalists can continue to call themselves journalists if they aren’t brave enough to ask a question. I mean, how big does the elephant in the room have to be before you ask about it?”</strong></p><p>We would have to agree. Cruise has avoided talking about his religion for a long time despite accusations against him.</p><h2 id=seinfeld-liked-to-dabble-in-scientology><strong>Seinfeld Liked To Dabble In Scientology</strong></h2><p>Even Jerry Seinfeld got sucked into the religion around the same time that Cruise did. Whether Cruise brought him into the fold or not is hard to say. Seinfeld found that it just wasn’t for him and after taking some classes, he left the church — no big surprise there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“I did some Scientology courses about 30 years ago. The only thing that bothers me about people knowing that is that it is not my complete wacko resume. It’s just one aspect!”</strong></p><p>He explained to Access Hollywood&nbsp;that he stopped because he was just testing the waters and was “flitting from thing to thing.” He’s probably glad that he got out of it now after all the bad press that’s been going on about the religion. Celebrities have given millions of dollars to the organization and we have to wonder where it would be without them.</p><h2 id=jenna-elfman-scared-katie-holmes><strong>Jenna Elfman Scared Katie Holmes</strong></h2><p>Jenna Elfman is another celebrity that is a Scientologist and loves everything about it. She’s also been known to denounce people who leave the church. She’s not really a big star anymore, so we’re not sure why Katie Holmes worried about her. But apparently, the two ended up on the same episode of&nbsp;Good Morning America in March of 2017 and Holmes was not happy about it. A source said,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“Backstage, Katie was terrified. She was literally hiding from her and she seemed scared. They had to change Katie’s dressing room because she wanted to be nowhere near the famous Scientologist.”</strong></p><p>Poor Katie probably thought that Jenna would drag her kicking and screaming back to the church.</p><h2 id=danny-masterson-was-protected-by-the-church><strong>Danny Masterson Was Protected By the Church</strong></h2><p>There is no doubt about it, Scientology is a little shifty and it’s the kind of religion that you have to keep an eye on. Danny Masterson is another celebrity that was wooed by the church. He is also no stranger to scandals which is not something the church likes. But they do protect their own, so when Masterson got accused of assault by four different women, then the church rallied around him. The Church of Scientology claimed that they did not know about the allegations against Masterson. Chris Shelton,&nbsp;a former Scientologist, said that the church would protect their members against the outside world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“[The Church of Scientology] considers anyone outside the church to be a ‘wog,’ which is a defamatory word describing non-members.</strong></p><p>It creates an ‘us versus them’ mentality [and tells] members that ‘wogs’ at law enforcement won’t protect them.”</p><h2 id=jason-beghe-thinks-it-s-messed-up><strong>Jason Beghe Thinks It’s Messed Up</strong></h2><p>Jason Beghe is most known for his role alongside Demi Moore in G.I. Jane as well as his role on Chicago P.D. So many stars have left Scientology and Beghe is one of them. He actually spent a whopping 13 years in the religion before he left it in 2007. When he left the church, he released a video on his views, says,</p><p><strong>“Scientology is destructive and a rip-off. It’s very, very dangerous for your spiritual, psychological, mental, emotional health, and evolution.</strong></p><p>I think it stunts your evolution. If Scientology is real, then something’s f**ked up.” Once these celebrities start talking, some really interesting things tend to come out.
