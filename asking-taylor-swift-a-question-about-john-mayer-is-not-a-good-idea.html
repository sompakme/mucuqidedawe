When conducted by someone good at their job, an interview can be engaging, informative, and serve to get people talking about that star and the project that they have on deck.</p><p>When interviews go off the rails, however, the conversation takes a totally different tone. All stars seem to face tough interviews, with some shutting things down, or even storming off <a href=#>after an interviewer crosses the line</a> with them.</p><p>Years ago, <strong><a href=#>Taylor Swift</a></strong> was in the midst of one of her most infamous moments, and an interviewer simply would not respect her boundaries and let things go. This led to the interview taking an unexpected turn for the worst, as Swift refused to answer the interviewers' questions.</p><p>Let's learn how not to conduct an interview, and how this isn't the only time that Swift has fielded tough questions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-has-a-history-of-shutting-down-interviewers>Taylor Swift Has A History Of Shutting Down Interviewers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/taylor-swift-sundance.jpg><p>By now, everyone knows about Kanye West interrupting Taylor Swift's acceptance speech all those years ago. At the time, it was major news, and for Swift, it was a wound that news outlets and radio stations wanted to open up time and time again.</p><p>When speaking <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">with MJ Morning Show</a>, Swift did her best to talk about anything else other than Kanye West, but the station wasn't interested in respecting her boundaries at the time.</p><p>Finally, enough was enough, and Swift set the record straight.</p><p>"I really would appreciate it if we could talk about something else, because I've asked you three times now, and I'm trying to be nice about it because it just isn't something we need to spend this whole interview talking about," she said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Instead of being cool about it, the host kicked it up a notch.</p><p>"Taylor, let me just give you a couple of tips here. You've got 10 or 12 radio stations lined up after me, and they're all going to want to talk about this, Taylor," the host replied.</p><p>"Absolutely, but I think that if I ask them three times and I've already talked about this in interviews...," Swift said.</p><p>The host still pressed Swift about the question, leading to the singer to pass the phone to her publicist, who then tried to shut things down.</p><p>"Hey guys, we've got to move on past that question. I'm sorry. Can we talk about something new, like her record, 'You Belong With Me' going #1?," her publicist said.</p><p>It was a bizarre and uncomfortable interview, and it's an example of a bizarre twist, and what happens when boundaries aren't respected.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For Swift, this was not the only time that she had to shut things down in an interview.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar51804042-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Travis Kelce’s Sister-In-Law Admits She’s Using Taylor Swift To Her Advantage</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Though Kylie Kelce has given her seal of approval, Travis' brother admits he's worried for his safety as he continues to date Taylor.</span><h2 id=taylor-swift-shut-down-an-interviewer-for-prying-into-her-romance-with-john-mayer>Taylor Swift Shut Down An Interviewer For Prying Into Her Romance With John Mayer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/taylor-swift-awards-2022-1.jpg><p>Following her romance with John Mayer, things got uncomfortable in an interview.</p><p>When the two had a falling out, Mayer responded to Swift's song, "Dear John," which was allegedly about the musician.</p><p>"I was really caught off-guard, and it really humiliated me at a time when I'd already been dressed down. I mean, how would you feel if, at the lowest you’ve ever been, someone kicked you even lower," Mayer said.</p><p>Mayer had more to say.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I will say as a songwriter that I think it's kind of cheap songwriting. I know she's the biggest thing in the world, and I'm not trying to sink anybody's ship, but I think it's abusing your talent to rub your hands together and go, 'Wait till he gets a load of this!' That's bulls***," he added.</p><p>Word was quick to spread, and in an interview, Swift was on the verge of having to hear Mayer's words, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">something that she wasn't interested in</a>.</p><p>"No! I don't want to know, I don't want to know... I know it wasn't good, so I don't want to know. I put a high priority on staying happy, and I know what I can't handle," Swift said.</p><p>"It's not that I'm this egomaniac and I don't want to hear anything negative, because I do keep myself in check. But I've never developed that thick a skin. So I just kind of live a life, and I let all the gossip live somewhere else. If you go too far down the rabbit hole of what people think about you, it can change everything about who you are," she added.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thankfully, this interview didn't press her nearly as badly as the other one did.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/taylor-swift-s-dad-slammed-after-his-cruel-comments-about-her-resurface.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift’s Dad Slammed By Fans After His Cruel Comments About Her Resurface</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's fans are calling her dad's comments misogynistic in newly leaked emails amid an ongoing lawsuit against the Swift family.</span><p>Taylor Swift has had some tense interview moments.
