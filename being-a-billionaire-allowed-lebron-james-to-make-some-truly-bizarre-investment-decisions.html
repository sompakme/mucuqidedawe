It really shouldn't be all that shocking. Aside from the hundreds of millions he's made from playing for teams such as the Los Angeles Lakers and Miami Heat, he's had other lucrative avenues of wealth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are his endorsement deals with Nike. Just like how Michael Jordan made billions from his iconic shoe brand, LeBron has made a bulk of his billion from his own shoe lines. He's also been a spokesperson for enormous companies such as AT&T, Pepsi, and Walmart.</p><p>In addition to all of that, LeBron has invested his money into major businesses. While lots of athletes and celebrities invest their money, James has gone above and beyond with his massive stakes. According to CNBC, LeBron has made $900 million from his investments, which is easily the biggest factor in his billion-dollar fortune. Here's what King James has wisely invested in.</p><h2 id=did-lebron-james-have-an-investment-in-mcdonald-39-s-like-travis-scott><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Did LeBron James Have An Investment In McDonald's Like Travis Scott?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/travis-scott-mcdonalds-promo.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>McDonald's is the world's biggest fast-food chain by a wide margin. Part of their success comes from their partnerships with celebrities like Travis Scott and Cardi B.</p><p>There's been a popular urban myth that LeBron invested in McDonald's, but that just isn't true. That story gets mixed up with the true story of LeBron turning down a game-changing McDonald's endorsement.</p><p>According to Sportscasting, LeBron turned down a $15 million contract in an early part of his career. At the time, it would have been the biggest fast-food endorsement in history in terms of money involved. LeBron never publicly disclosed why he rejected the Big Mac giant.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Sarah Michelle Gellar Was Completely Banned From McDonald's For A Pretty Legitimate Reason</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Regardless of the reason, McDonald's will always have an important spot in LeBron's heart, as the corporation sponsored LeBron's high-school breakout game.

Former president Donald Trump <a href=#>famously had a $1 million partnership with Pizza Hut</a> that helped elevate the corporation to new heights. Shaq has an exclusive pizza that Papa John's sells seasonally once a year.</p><p>LeBron may not have joined forces with McDonald's, but he did join Trump and Shaq by allying himself with a pizza chain. According to Wolf of Franchises, LeBron is both a spokesperson and a part-owner of Blaze Pizza.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Blaze Pizza is proof of LeBron's investing genius. His initial investment into the company was back in 2012 when the company just had a few locations. The store now has an astounding 340 locations in the United States, in large part due to LeBron's power as a company mascot.</p><p>He currently has an equity stake of $40 million.</p><h2 id=does-lebron-james-have-an-investment-in-the-boston-red-sox><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Does Lebron James Have An Investment In The Boston Red Sox?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lebron-james-1.jpg><p>One of LeBron's craziest investments is this one.</p><p>It may not be a shock that LeBron has invested in something revolving around sports. However, owning a piece of a sports franchise is pretty out there. Not only does he own part of a sports team, but he just so happens to own a minor stake in the Boston Red Sox, one of the biggest franchises in all of sports.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Celebrities Who Are Fans of the Boston Red Sox</a></span></p><p>According to The New York Times, LeBron purchased his share back in 2021.

Aside from his stake in the Boston Red Sox, he also played tight end in high school. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He was very successful with his football endeavors</a>, scoring 27 touchdowns in just 2 seasons.

At this point, the superstar athlete has become synonymous with the sport. <a href=#>Lebron admitted he felt intimidated and pressured into starring in Space Jam 2</a>, but no other basketball player could possibly fit the shoes of Michael Jordan. Perhaps Kevin Durant or Steph Curry could, but Lebron was the obvious fill-in for this generation.</p><p>Many fans have been curious as to what King James would invest in regarding basketball. While LeBron can't invest in an NBA team as he's still a player, if his net worth continues to increase, he could easily own a team. George Halas, Michael Jordan, and Derek Jeter are examples of superstar athletes or coaches owning a team.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to LeBron himself, he wants to skip coaching and broadcasting in order to outright own a team. According to Bleacher Report, James has talked to Adam Silver about owning a hypothetical expansion team in Las Vegas. Time will tell, but it will take a while. LeBron is still waiting to retire in order to play with his son Bronny.</p><h2 id=what-real-estate-has-lebron-james-invested-in><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>What Real Estate Has Lebron James Invested In?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lebron-james-dunking.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lebron has quite an impressive real estate portfolio</a>.

Since then, the company has produced Space Jam: A New Legacy, as well as Adam Sandler's Hustle.
