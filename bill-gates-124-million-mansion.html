In 1985, the duo launched the first version of Microsoft Windows and went public a year later. <a href=#>His net worth jumped to $350 million</a>, and within a year, Gates became a billionaire at 31. Even after stepping down from the day-to-day operations and later stepping down as the Chairman, he remains on the top 5 list of the wealthiest people in the world. <a href=#>Gates has a massive net worth of $118 billion</a>, and while he has cut down on his expenses, his biggest purchase remains the Seattle mansion worth $124 million.</p><p>Bill Gates has invested in multiple real estate properties, which have soared in prices, and often bought supercars due to his love for speed. Called the Xanadu 2.0 by Gates and his family, the mansion is an incredible innovation in architecture with amenities everywhere. Let’s take a look inside Bill Gates’ $124 million estate, Xanadu 2.0.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=constructed-from-scratch>Constructed From Scratch</h2><p>https://in.pinterest.com/pin/529102656213633985/</p><p>As Bill Gates was born and brought up in Seattle and opened the Microsoft headquarters in the same city, it is no surprise that the mogul wanted to build a massive mansion in his hometown. In 1988, he purchased the lake-front land for $2 million, and it took seven years to build the 66,000-square-foot dream home that the Gates family wanted. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a>, he spent $63 million on constructing the home and named it Xanadu 2.0. The name refers to the luxurious home of the fictional character Charles Foster Kane in the film <i>Citizen Kane</i>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Million-Dollar Dinners: The 10 Most Expensive Dining Tables In The World</a></span></p><p>Bill Gates not only spent money on construction but also bought the neighboring properties for $14 million to ensure the family had ample privacy around the area. Xanadu 2.0 is designed with a Pacific lodge theme in mind as it was inspired by the materials found in the Pacific Northwest. Along with using seven types of stones, more than 500 years old Douglas Fir trees were used for construction, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Re-Thinking The Future</a>. The estate required the labor of 300 people, out of which 100 were electricians.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=endless-rooms-and-space>Endless Rooms And Space</h2><p><a href=#>The home's interior was designed</a> by French architect Thierry Despont, an associate architect while restoring the Statue of Liberty in the 1980s. The house has seven bedrooms, 24 bathrooms, and six kitchens. Each of the six kitchens is located in corners, so one is always within reach. The formal dining hall can accommodate 200 people, while a more intimate room seats 24 people close to the fireplace. Additionally, the mansion has a steam room, sauna, and a gym that spans 25,000 square feet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a lover of art and literature, Bill Gates has given special attention to ensuring artwork and books are displayed perfectly. Paintings are projected on computer screens stuck to the wall to form a single frame. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo Finance</a>, Gates has installed a 2,100-square-foot library with a reading dome with a quote from The Great Gatsby novel. The room also holds the artwork Codex Leicester by Leonardo Da Vinci, which Gates purchased for $30.8 million at an auction. One of the rooms in his home is turned into a trampoline complex with a 20-foot ceiling.</p><h2 id=combination-of-natural-elements-with-technology>Combination Of Natural Elements With Technology</h2><p>Bill Gates has incorporated many elements and ecosystems into creating a peaceful home. A large aquarium is located in a living room to preserve rare marine life. Outdoors, the house has a 60-foot swimming pool, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>. Interestingly, it is also believed that Gates created an artificial beach with sand imported from Hawaii. The home has an artificial stream with trout and salmon creating their natural habitat. Tall trees surround the estate to regulate the temperature and keep pleasant weather around the property.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Security has always been paramount for the Gates family</a>, and strict visitor protocols exist. With the installed IT Integration System, visitors wear an electronic pin scanned while entering. The technology also manages the room climate and plays music from the system installed inside the walls. Multiple garages accommodate cars, with the underground garage holding ten vehicles at once.</p><p>Additionally, the mansion has a reception hall, a home theater for 20 people, and a 10-person jacuzzi on the pool deck. Overlooking King County and Lake Washington, Bill Gates has created a stunning property in Medina, Washington, that has been far ahead of its time and continues to amaze people.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>A Look At Kim K's Dating History: All Of Kim Kardashian's Boyfriends, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Re-Thinking The Future</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo Finance</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaipqOesaZ515qlmpylYn9ufIyboKWkXZyutbHSZmhrbF2itq24yKilZqWRo8Cqu81o</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbill-gates-124-million-mansion.html&text=Bill%20Gates%27%20%24124%20Million%20Mansion&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbill-gates-124-million-mansion.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbill-gates-124-million-mansion.html&title=Bill%20Gates%27%20%24124%20Million%20Mansion" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbill-gates-124-million-mansion.html&title=Bill%20Gates%27%20%24124%20Million%20Mansion" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbill-gates-124-million-mansion.html&title=Bill%20Gates%27%20%24124%20Million%20Mansion" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbill-gates-124-million-mansion.html&description=Bill%20Gates%27%20%24124%20Million%20Mansion" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./danny-bonaduce-net-worth-how-much-is-bonaduce-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Danny Bonaduce Net Worth  How Much is Bonaduce Worth?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ashley-tisdale-was-emotional-learning-austin-butler-is-her-cousin.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ashley Tisdale Was 'Emotional' Learning Austin Butler Is Her Cousin">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
