Combining her talent in songwriting and producing and the heart-aching lyrics she provides to her audience, no one can seem to stop Billie from reaching anything she wants in the music industry. However, as she grew older and met new people, she proved that no one is exempted from heartbreak, even the award-winning artists. But how did she use her heartbreak to create a Grammy Award-winning song?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>How did Brandon Adams influence Billie Eilish's songwriting after they broke up? What does Billie have to say about her ex-boyfriend? Did Billie Eilish want revenge on Brandon Adams, or are they already on good terms? Keep reading to find out the truth...</p><h2 id=who-is-brandon-adams>Who Is Brandon Adams?</h2><p>Brandon Adams, Q as Billie calls him or 7:AMP as his public title, is an American rapper and songwriter aged 26 as of 2022. Billie and Brandon became a couple in 2018 when Billie was still 17 years old, and Brandon was 22 years old. Their five-year age gap caused a lot of negative comments online as most of Billie's fans consider Brandon a groomer, someone who is in a relationship with a minor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Billie proudly showed Brandon in social media posts; the same goes for Brandon, as he even made Billie a cover in one of his songs. However, things drifted apart between them after less than a year of dating. The two broke up in 2019 to much of Billie's fans' approval.</p><h2 id=what-does-billie-eilish-think-of-her-ex-boyfriend-brandon-adams>What Does Billie Eilish Think Of Her Ex-Boyfriend Brandon Adams?</h2><p>Despite the heartbreak she had gone through, Billie Eilish didn't want fans to get angry at her ex-boyfriend, Q. Although her fans were furious about their relationship and relieved that it ended quickly, teen Billie didn't want to bring more negativity to her ex-boyfriend's life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Billie opened up about her struggle in keeping afloat with Brandon, saying, "And there was just a lack of effort [from Brandon Adams], I think. I was like, 'Dude [Brandon Adams], you don't even have enough love to love yourself. You can't love me."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About Billie Eilish's Extremely Complicated Life</a></span></p><p>After fans heard her statement, it seemed like it added more fuel to the fire as they began bombarding Brandon with negative comments and direct messages on his social media months after Billie's official announcement of their separation.</p><h2 id=why-did-billie-eilish-and-brandon-adams-break-up>Why Did Billie Eilish and Brandon Adams Break Up?</h2><p>In Billie Eilish's 2021 Apple TV documentary entitled "Billie Eilish: The World's A Little Blurry," she opens up about her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">separation from her ex-boyfriend, Brandon Adams.</a> The singer says, "I just wasn't happy [with their relationship]. And I didn't want the same things he [Brandon Adams] wanted, and I don't think that's fair for him. I don't think you should be in a relationship, super excited about certain things that the other person couldn't care less about."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Billie Eilish was not the only one affected by their breakup, as even <a href=#>Brandon Adams disappeared from social media after their separation</a>. After Billie Eilish's Apple TV documentary aired, many of her fans began leaving hateful comments on Brandon, telling him how poorly he treated Billie despite having no idea about their private interactions.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Billie Eilish's Boyfriend Matthew Tyler Vorce Have A High Net Worth?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brandon, however, didn't back down from the bashing he received. In an<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Instagram post addressing the issue</a>, he says, "'There are always two sides to a situation [about their breakup]. People fail to realize I've been dealing with my brother's death, especially around that time when it was fresh. Sometimes people disagree and don't want the same things as one another. It's on you to understand that a situation has several points of view."</p><h2 id=billie-eilish-39-s-song-happier-than-ever-dedication>Billie Eilish's Song Happier Than Ever Dedication</h2><p>After Billie Eilish's 2021 Grammy Award-winning song Happier Than Ever became a global hit, her fans began to speculate that it could be Brandon Adams that Billie was writing about in the song. Like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Capital FM tried to decode the meaning of Happier Than Ever</a>, fans believe the song is addressed toward Brandon, who didn't match her interests with his anymore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since the lyrics say, "You do the opposite of what you said you'd do, and I'd end up more afraid. Don't say it isn't fair. You werе aware that you made me misеrable", it matches with fans' speculations that it might be Billie's way of indirectly throwing shade at her ex. To an extent, some fans even believe that Billie receiving a Grammy Award for her song was the best revenge she could give to Brandon.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why Billie Eilish Is Nervous About Attending The Oscars</a></span></p><p><a href=#>Billie Eilish's most recent ex-boyfriend, Matthew Tyler Vorce,</a> also attested to how wrong social media, especially Billie's fans defending her, can spread rumors. He and Billie recently broke up in May 2022, and similar to how Billie also didn't want her fans to give negative comments to Brandon, she also asked them to leave Matthew Tyler alone. However, this is, again, the opposite of what her fans did.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Not Everyone Is Thrilled About Billie Eilish Commenting On The Heard-Depp Trial In Her New Song</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigrGWSnrmttcRmnKKkmai1br%2FIp56lnV2axW6uzrKdq6GVo7FuvYybqZqmlKS7bq3DmqSsZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbillie-eilish-s-sweet-revenge-to-ex-boyfriend-brandon-adams-got-her-a-grammy-award.html&text=Billie%20Eilish%27s%20Sweet%20Revenge%20To%20Ex-Boyfriend%20Brandon%20Adams%20Got%20Her%20A%20Grammy%20Award&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbillie-eilish-s-sweet-revenge-to-ex-boyfriend-brandon-adams-got-her-a-grammy-award.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbillie-eilish-s-sweet-revenge-to-ex-boyfriend-brandon-adams-got-her-a-grammy-award.html&title=Billie%20Eilish%27s%20Sweet%20Revenge%20To%20Ex-Boyfriend%20Brandon%20Adams%20Got%20Her%20A%20Grammy%20Award" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbillie-eilish-s-sweet-revenge-to-ex-boyfriend-brandon-adams-got-her-a-grammy-award.html&title=Billie%20Eilish%27s%20Sweet%20Revenge%20To%20Ex-Boyfriend%20Brandon%20Adams%20Got%20Her%20A%20Grammy%20Award" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbillie-eilish-s-sweet-revenge-to-ex-boyfriend-brandon-adams-got-her-a-grammy-award.html&title=Billie%20Eilish%27s%20Sweet%20Revenge%20To%20Ex-Boyfriend%20Brandon%20Adams%20Got%20Her%20A%20Grammy%20Award" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbillie-eilish-s-sweet-revenge-to-ex-boyfriend-brandon-adams-got-her-a-grammy-award.html&description=Billie%20Eilish%27s%20Sweet%20Revenge%20To%20Ex-Boyfriend%20Brandon%20Adams%20Got%20Her%20A%20Grammy%20Award" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./david-foster-wallace-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="David Foster Wallace Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./18-work-clothes-that-double-as-going-out-clothes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="18 Work Clothes That Double as Going Out Clothes">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
