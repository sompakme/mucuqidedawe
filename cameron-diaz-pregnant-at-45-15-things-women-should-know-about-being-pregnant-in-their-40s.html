There have been a lot of speculations about the relationship between Cameron Diaz and her husband of three years Benji Madden. It’s been alleged that she was trying to get pregnant as a means of saving a failing marriage. For whatever the reason, it seems as if Diaz got her wish. Photos of the actress have circulated that showed a possible baby bump. That’s what has the rumor mills talking and we’re hoping that the news is true. The two have been seen out recently and it appears as if Diaz is cradling her stomach as she walks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, what does it means for a woman her age to be pregnant? Some women decide to have children later in life these days because they are more focused on their career or maybe they just haven’t met the right guy. There was a time when having a child in your&nbsp;40s was considered to be dangerous or unhealthy, but doctors are more able to guide a woman through the process these days. There still are some concerns, some risks involved when having a baby later on in life.</p><p>The good thing about Diaz and a lot of women these days, they take really good care of themselves and their bodies. They exercise and put good things into their body which is only going to benefit them when it comes time to getting pregnant and going into labor, even if it's a little later in life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=increase-in-genetic-risks><strong>Increase In Genetic Risks</strong></h2><p>The&nbsp;last thing that you want to worry about when you’re pregnant is what could be going on genetically in your body. For women who chose to have a baby after the age of 40 the risks of genetic risks increase. However, it’s not always the case, especially if you are someone who has always been in good physical shape. It’s always good to talk to your doctor or even meet with a genetic counselor to discuss the risks. Both you and your partner can get tested and determine what kind of risks you could be looking at. It’s not an easy test and it can certainly be stressful for both of you, but at least you will know what you’re dealing with. The situation can be made so much worse if you are surprised later on in the pregnancy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=problems-during-labor><strong>Problems During Labor</strong></h2><p>If you are a woman that likes to stay in shape and you are in the gym even though you’re in your 40s, then this may be less of a risk for you. Studies have shown that women who work out during their pregnancy are less likely to have difficult labors. So, for unhealthy women, you run the risk of dealing with long and dangerous labors. In general, however, studies have shown that women who are having their first child over the age of 40 run the risk of having longer and lengthy second-stage labors. We already know that labor can be an exhausting and difficult task for women, so the last thing you want to hear is that your age may cause you to have prolonged labor. There is also a higher chance of having fetal distress during labor if you are over the age of 40.</p><h2 id=chromosomal-abnormalities><strong>Chromosomal Abnormalities</strong></h2><p>One thing you have to consider when having a baby after 40 is chromosomal abnormalities. For every 1000 women, 25 of them over the age of 40 could have abnormalities. What does that mean? It means that when your baby is developing these abnormalities, it could cause unusual fetal development. Again, it’s recommended that both the woman and her partner are tested to determine if these abnormalities are possible. There are certain tests such as CVS (chorionic villus sampling) that can determine whether there are abnormalities or not early on in your pregnancy. The only downside to the test is that there is a risk just like with amniocentesis that the procedure could cause a miscarriage, though the risk is small. This allows you to make the best decisions possible for your family. It’s usually only recommended, however, if your doctor or fertility specialist thinks that it’s a good idea.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=changing-your-bad-habits><strong>Changing Your Bad Habits</strong></h2><p>If you’re going to be over the age of 40 and having a baby, then you need to be at your healthiest. It’s best for the baby, as well as the mother,&nbsp;to make healthy choices throughout&nbsp;the pregnancy. So, if you liked your fast food before, then your pregnancy is probably a great time to cut those things out, at least for the time being. If the woman has also experienced any issues with fibroids, diabetes, or has any type of heart issues that could compromise the child’s health or her own then she needs to get control of them as soon as possible. Controlling your high blood pressure, obesity, as well as issues with thyroid disease, are equally as important to control during this time. You must be at your best possible health so that you can give both you and your baby the best chance possible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=prenatal-vitamins-are-a-must><strong>Prenatal Vitamins Are A Must</strong></h2><p>We talk about how women should be at their healthiest during this time, and it’s not just about eating properly and exercise. Vitamins are essential during pregnancy; it’s not the same a forgetting to take a multivitamin. Most women when they find out that they are pregnant don’t know exactly when they got pregnant unless they have been working with a fertility specialist. Prenatal vitamins that contain folic acid are vitally important to take for women of any age, but when you are having a baby over the age of 40, it is that much more important. These vitamins are there to prevent diseases such as spina bifida and neural tube defects. These vitamins aren’t miracles pills and they won’t guarantee that there won’t be any issues, but they will decrease the risk. Women over the age of 40 should be doing everything in their power to ensure they have a healthy pregnancy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=increased-risk-of-preeclampsia><strong>Increased Risk Of Preeclampsia</strong></h2><p>Preeclampsia is something that can happen to anyone during their pregnancy, but the risk is increased for women over 40. This can be a serious and very uncomfortable condition that causes swelling in the face and hands, high blood pressure as well as odd looking urine. It’s so serious that it can cause complications in the pregnancy by impairing the nervous system, causing strokes or seizures which can be pretty scary for a woman who is trying to protect her child. Experts are unsure as to why the complications increase when you are over 40, but it’s something to take into consideration. It’s always a good idea to keep in contact with your doctor and if you experience any abnormal symptoms during your pregnancy, it's best to contact your doctor immediately. There are many precautions that can be taken to prevent preeclampsia from happening.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hospital-birth-may-be-a-safer-option><strong>Hospital Birth May Be A Safer Option</strong></h2><p>We are definitely in the age where you don’t necessarily have to have your baby in the hospital if you don’t want to. Many women are opting for home births or water births to allow for a more natural experience for their baby. When it comes to having a baby after the age of 40, you may want to forgo the idea of a natural experience in lieu of safety. If complications do arise during your labor, you want to make sure that you have everything that technology has to offer in order to get your child into the world safely. If you want a doula or a midwife, most hospitals will allow them in the room for you so you will still have that support system with you. You can still have a natural experience in the hospital as a doula can help you to move around and deal with the pain naturally.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mom-s-health-is-at-risk-too><strong>Mom’s Health Is At Risk, Too</strong></h2><p>Being over 40 brings along an increase of health risks for the mother not just for the baby. A woman can experience things like preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, high blood pressure and placenta praevia. You will find that your doctor will monitor you closely throughout your pregnancy and that includes your blood pressure and urine being constantly checked. There certainly are a lot of risks when it comes to having a baby in your 40’s, but it’s also nice to know that there are many women in their 40’s that have had children and never experience any of these problems. Having children in your 40’s doesn’t guarantee that something will go wrong. It’s just good for you to know that you have to be at your healthiest during this time. It’s best to know these risks ahead of time so that you can watch out for anything suspicious.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=low-birth-weight><strong>Low Birth Weight</strong></h2><p>One of the risks of having a baby in your 40s is that the baby may be born early or at a low birth weight. Thankfully, we live in an era where there are lots of things that can be done for your baby if he/she is born prematurely or at a low weight. There are a lot of times that this has happened even to mother’s that aren’t in their 40s and the babies continue to thrive after they have left the hospital. When most women find out they are pregnant and are at a high risk, they will do whatever they have to do during the pregnancy to ensure&nbsp; their child has a fighting chance. Of course, your doctor will provide you with care and instructions to ensure you’re doing everything to ensure that your baby's weight is adequate.</p><h2 id=increased-chance-of-premature-babies><strong>Increased Chance Of Premature Babies</strong></h2><p>Any woman at any age can end up having her baby a little early, but the chances of having a premature baby when you’re over 40 is a lot higher. Again, when you are older, a doctor will be monitoring you closely and will be looking out for things like this. Your doctor will make you aware of the chances that you have and what you can do to try to prevent it. There will be of course symptoms to watch out for. The goal between doctor and patient will be to ensure that the woman has the healthiest delivery possible. Any health concerns you have throughout your pregnancy will be documented so that you can get the best medical care possible when the delivery happens. If the baby does come early, there is no reason to stress; the hospital will have methods of allowing the mother to have physical contact with the child as well as the equipment that allows the baby to grow stronger.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=anxiety-about-the-pregnancy><strong>Anxiety About The Pregnancy</strong></h2><p>Finding out that a she is pregnant in her 40s can cause some anxiety in a woman even if it’s something she wants. At some point or another, the worry that a woman is “too old” to be pregnant will creep into her mind. It’s not even the health concerns that have them worrying, but more the fact that they may be considered “older” parents in their future child’s classroom. Will someone think that they are their child’s grandparents instead of their parent? This, of course, is becoming more of a norm because women are deciding to have children later on in life. But it can make a woman worry nonetheless, but at the end of the day, as long as mom and baby are happy and healthy, then the rest shouldn’t really matter. We all have issues as new parents and there are women who have children young and have to worry about their own stigma.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=be-prepared-for-lots-of-tests><strong>Be Prepared For Lots Of Tests</strong></h2><p>Getting tests done all the time can be a real bummer but it’s something that you will just have to get used to if you are going to have a baby in your 40s. Because of your age, it is likely that you are going to have more doctor’s appointments than normal because your doctor wants to know that things are following along as they should be. That can also mean more tests than what normally happens during a pregnancy. It’s not going to be fun and it’s likely going to become annoying having to go to one appointment after another but when it comes to the safety of you and your baby you just have to do what it takes. You may have your regular doctor as well as a fertility specialist that wants to see you throughout the pregnancy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=it-may-require-extra-support><strong>It May Require Extra Support</strong></h2><p>There is no better time for you to get extra support from your family and friends then when you are pregnant. When you are pregnant in your 40s, there are a higher delivery and pregnancy risks and that means you might need some extra love and support during your pregnancy. It would be great for you to have your own cheerleading team who can help you when you start to freak out about having a baby at your age. It’s going to be normal for you to have feelings of fear or nervousness and having an extra support system will help you through these moments. This support system can come in the form of cooking for you when you feel like you don’t have anything more to give or just to offer you a shoulder to cry on if you are having a hard day.</p><h2 id=you-may-have-to-be-induced><strong>You May Have To Be Induced</strong></h2><p>Don’t fret, this doesn’t always happen. There are many women in their 40s that go through labor naturally and don’t need to be induced. But some women in their 40s find that being induced is necessary. In some cases, the delivery will happen normally after as well, but there have also been times when a woman has required a C-section even after being induced. We’ve discussed how deliveries can be more difficult when you’re in your 40s, so going into surgery might be necessary to ensure a safe delivery. Not to worry, most caesarian sections are completed without a hitch. Both mother and child are closely monitored throughout the procedure. Again, this is another reason why it’s a good idea to be in your best health throughout your pregnancy. If you do have issues throughout your pregnancy, it will only mean that there will be extra precautions taken when you are in labor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=always-have-a-plan><strong>Always Have A Plan&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>One thing that any woman should do despite their age is to have a good birthing plan set into place before you go into labor. Being over 40 may mean, however, that your plan falls apart when it comes to the third trimester or even when you go into labor. It’s a good idea to have a backup plan just in case your original birth plan doesn’t work. Just be flexible with your birth plan just in case complications arise. If your plan is to go through childbirth without drugs, that’s great, but there has to be another plan in place just in case there are complications during labor. It may mean you have to adjust your plan slightly and take drugs if necessary. If your plan changes throughout the process, it doesn’t mean you are weaker, it just means that some adjustments had to be made to ensure you have a safe delivery.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmoaGXnXqttcWeZpyZnZq%2FsLqMnaCasl2lv6azzZqlrWWRqXp1gYxqbGasmJ67qL%2BMsKamnZ5iwKm71KWbZqOepMRurcGorK1lkpq2r7OMqamen56Wu7V5yKdkraCVnr9ugI%2BsZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcameron-diaz-pregnant-at-45-15-things-women-should-know-about-being-pregnant-in-their-40s.html&text=Cameron%20Diaz%20Pregnant%20At%2045%3a%2015%20Things%20Women%20Should%20Know%20About%20Being%20Pregnant%20In%20Their%2040s&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcameron-diaz-pregnant-at-45-15-things-women-should-know-about-being-pregnant-in-their-40s.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcameron-diaz-pregnant-at-45-15-things-women-should-know-about-being-pregnant-in-their-40s.html&title=Cameron%20Diaz%20Pregnant%20At%2045%3a%2015%20Things%20Women%20Should%20Know%20About%20Being%20Pregnant%20In%20Their%2040s" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcameron-diaz-pregnant-at-45-15-things-women-should-know-about-being-pregnant-in-their-40s.html&title=Cameron%20Diaz%20Pregnant%20At%2045%3a%2015%20Things%20Women%20Should%20Know%20About%20Being%20Pregnant%20In%20Their%2040s" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcameron-diaz-pregnant-at-45-15-things-women-should-know-about-being-pregnant-in-their-40s.html&title=Cameron%20Diaz%20Pregnant%20At%2045%3a%2015%20Things%20Women%20Should%20Know%20About%20Being%20Pregnant%20In%20Their%2040s" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcameron-diaz-pregnant-at-45-15-things-women-should-know-about-being-pregnant-in-their-40s.html&description=Cameron%20Diaz%20Pregnant%20At%2045%3a%2015%20Things%20Women%20Should%20Know%20About%20Being%20Pregnant%20In%20Their%2040s" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./chrissie-hynde-net-worth-therichest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chrissie Hynde Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./a-peek-inside-the-british-royal-family-s-car-collection.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Peek Inside The British Royal Family's Car Collection">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
