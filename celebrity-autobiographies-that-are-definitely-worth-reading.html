The big question is where to find it. Some might opt for their friends' and families' advice, or even reach out to their career mentor or a senior at their field of work. But when the ground shrinks under those who still can't for the life of them figure out what to do, these celebrity memoirs might offer a hand in regard to that complex ordeal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Because celebrities' lives are always exposed to the public, they often think that they have already seen what a celebrity is all about. But the truth is that there is an infinite number of situations, decisions, experiences, failures, and success that any person goes through in order to be who they are today, especially celebrities. On a first look, they might be living a life of luxury now, but the past might hold endless insights, and the present isn't always what it seems. Nevertheless, what's comes easy to conclude is that some celebrities have had an eventful life to say the least, and these memoirs and autobiographies if not full of lessons to learn, they're at least quite an interesting read.</p><h2 id=tina-fey-39-s-bossypants-is-a-memoir-filled-with-endless-show-business-behind-the-scenes><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Tina Fey's Bossypants Is A Memoir Filled With Endless Show Business Behind The Scenes</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Comedy mastermind and the genius that brought fans the much adored Mean Girls film Tina Fey had her memoir published way back in 2011 to somewhat of mixed reviews. Her book Bossypants talks about her struggle all the way to becoming comedy royalty. Fey does not really take readers on a narrative journey, she more or less deals with different aspects in her life like a comedy sketch, which could come as a bit troll-y to some fans, but to others, it is just a way of not taking one's self too seriously.</p><p>Among many other things, <a href=#>she takes readers behind the scenes of her time at Saturday Night Live</a>, and provides witty commentary for pretty much everything. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times described her book as</a> "Bossypants isn’t a memoir. It’s a spiky blend of humor, introspection, critical thinking and Nora Ephron-isms for a new generation."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Tina Fey Called This Reality Star &#34;Awful&#34; During Her 'SNL' Appearance">Tina Fey Called This Reality Star "Awful" During Her 'SNL' Appearance</a></span></p><h2 id=dave-grohl-39-s-the-storyteller-takes-fans-into-a-deep-dive-of-his-rock-star-life><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Dave Grohl's The Storyteller Takes Fans Into A Deep Dive Of His Rock Star Life</span></h2><p>Dave Grohl is already in fans' rock and roll hall of fame for his iconic and unforgettable music career. He was the drummer for Nirvana, which needs no introduction, and he was the mind behind Foo Fighters, which initially started as a one-man rock band by Grohl until other members and lifelong friends joined him. His memoir, The Storyteller, Tales of Life and Music goes over all his experiences in his extensive career as a musician, and it offers fans an unfiltered, never before insight into the real Dave, the one who suffered, who prospered and persevered.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>He shared his thoughts about endeavoring to write this project saying,</a> "I still don’t read books about rock stars. I don’t read rock biographies, therefore I don’t know how to write one! I just knew I didn’t want to write a formulaic, chronological, informational rock biography. I have read a few of those. Yes, I want to know what studio (they worked in), what microphone they use, how they wrote this song. But I didn’t want to do that.

The memoir candidly offers up the numerous life lessons the actor has learned from his reflections and his own old diary entries, all in McConaughy's distinctive narrative voice. The memoir is a New York Times bestseller, and was described as "The No. 1 celebrity memoir of the past 10 years," by USA Today, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">had rave reviews like,</a> "McConaughey’s book invites us to grapple with the lessons of his life as he did—and to see that the point was never to win, but to understand.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=former-first-lady-michelle-obama-39-s-memoir-becoming-turned-heads-everywhere><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Former First Lady Michelle Obama's Memoir Becoming Turned Heads Everywhere</span></h2><p>The former first lady Michelle Obama <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">published her memoir in back in 2018</a> as a very sincere account into her personal and professional life. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times raved about the book saying,</a> "Becoming is refined and forthright, gracefully written and at times laugh-out-loud funny, with a humbler tone and less name-dropping than might be expected of one who is on chatting terms with the queen of England."</p><h2 id=tina-brown-39-s-the-vanity-fair-diaries-is-one-juicy-memoir><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Tina Brown's The Vanity Fair Diaries Is One Juicy Memoir</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Former Vanity Fair editor-in-chief Tina Brown published a tell-all book about all that went on behind the scenes of glam, culture, fashion, and what it takes to be the one behind it all.
