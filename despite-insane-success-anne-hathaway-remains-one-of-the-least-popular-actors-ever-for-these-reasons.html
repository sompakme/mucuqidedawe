And why is she not given the same accommodations as many other stars? Was one perceived mistake enough to write her off? Despite this, Anne Hathaway has not let her lack of popularity destroy her. In fact, it's been quite the opposite...</p><h2 id=what-has-anne-hathaway-achieved-in-her-career>What Has Anne Hathaway Achieved In Her Career?</h2><p>Whether you like Anne Hathaway or not, you cannot deny that she has had an impressive career. She is also a versatile actress, playing comedic roles and taking on more serious parts. Some of her standout performances include Love & Other Drugs, Les Misérables, and The Princess Diaries (and fans have been waiting for what feels like <a href=#>forever for the third film, Princess Diaries 3</a>, to come out).</p><p>Over the course of her career, she has been nominated for multiple awards and taken home several prestigious trophies, most notably her Oscar win in 2013. This was for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in Les Misérables.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Anne Hathaway Almost Quit Acting, But This $178 Million Movie With Heath Ledger Changed Her Career Path</a></span></p><p>She's a bit of an unstoppable force and continues to work steadily in Hollywood. She has also amassed an impressive net worth. According to Celebrity Net Worth, her wealth is estimated to be $80 million. Speaking of her career, Hathaway is honest about not thinking she would have the success that she has.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/anne-hathaway-2.jpg><p>"I never thought that things would go this well, and I never thought that I'd still be, like, hitting the pavement as hard as I am now," Hathaway told Entertainment Tonight. "But I do love it. I really feel lucky to do it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite all of this, Hathaway remains one of the least likable actresses. While there are some stars who can do anything and are considered total sweethearts and further endear themselves to fans, why can't Anne Hathaway do the same?</p><h2 id=why-do-so-many-people-hate-anne-hathaway>Why Do So Many People Hate Anne Hathaway?</h2><p>Anne Hathaway's love-and hate-relationship with the public is well-known, and many will argue it's completely unfounded. It has been documented, and there was even a catching hashtag to accompany it (#Hathahate). It is because people hated her choice of films? Was it something she said in the media that caused outrage? It can be incredibly challenging to pinpoint why Hathaway became the subject of so much backlash, but it may have started in 2013.</p><p>Of course, <a href=#>reports about her being difficult to work with have also not helped the situation</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Anne Hathaway Never Felt Comfortable In The Set Of The Devil Wears Prada For This Reason</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Oscars are often celebrated as a night to remember for film fans, and many stars consider winning one the highest honor. For Hathaway, this was not the case. She was unhappy, despite perhaps trying to pretend she was at the time. Her speech annoyed people more than it should have, and she became the topic of much discussion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/anne-hathaway-3.jpg><p>She later spoke about her speech with The Guardian. "I felt very uncomfortable. I kind of lost my mind doing that movie, and it hadn't come back yet. Then I had to stand up in front of people and feel something I don't feel which is uncomplicated happiness," she explained.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It's<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> an obvious thing, you win an Oscar, and you're supposed to be happy</a>. I didn't feel that way… I tried to pretend that I was happy and I got called out on it, big time. That's the truth and that's what happened. It sucks. But what you learn from it is that you only feel like you can die from embarrassment, you don't actually die."</p><p>It wasn't just her public image that was hurt by this moment, but also her career. "I had directors say to me, 'I think you're great. You're perfect for this role, but I don't know how audiences will accept you because of all this stuff, this baggage,'" she told Harper's Bazaar.</p><p>She noted that Christopher Nolan's film, Interstellar, helped put her back in the limelight (even if she <a href=#>thought one scene was not going according to plan</a>).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-has-anne-hathaway-said-about-all-the-hate>What Has Anne Hathaway Said About All The Hate?</h2><p>Having to constantly read negative things about yourself in the media must be incredibly difficult, especially when much of what is being said is untrue or unfair.

Those are impressive comments, to say the least, because no one likes to receive backlash, especially not for something that happened a decade prior.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/anne-hathaway-4.jpg><p>"Ten years ago, I was given an opportunity to look at the language of hatred from a new perspective," she said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"When your self-inflicted pain is suddenly somehow amplified back at you at, say, the full volume of the internet… It's a thing. When what happened, happened, I realized I had no desire to have anything to do with this line of energy. On any level. I would no longer create art from this place. I would no longer hold space for it, live in fear of it, nor speak its language for any reason. To anyone. Including myself... Hate seems to me to be the opposite of life; in soil that harsh, nothing can grow properly, if at all."</p><p>Can you still be mad at Anne Hathaway when she's been willing to move past all the negative feedback she has received and view things in a positive light?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbxuv85mpJqmqWK9prvPpZxmoJGpsm6tzaecZqCRqbWiw8CyZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdespite-insane-success-anne-hathaway-remains-one-of-the-least-popular-actors-ever-for-these-reasons.html&text=Despite%20Insane%20Success%2c%20Anne%20Hathaway%20Remains%20One%20Of%20The%20Least%20Popular%20Actors%20Ever%20For%20These%20Reasons&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdespite-insane-success-anne-hathaway-remains-one-of-the-least-popular-actors-ever-for-these-reasons.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdespite-insane-success-anne-hathaway-remains-one-of-the-least-popular-actors-ever-for-these-reasons.html&title=Despite%20Insane%20Success%2c%20Anne%20Hathaway%20Remains%20One%20Of%20The%20Least%20Popular%20Actors%20Ever%20For%20These%20Reasons" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdespite-insane-success-anne-hathaway-remains-one-of-the-least-popular-actors-ever-for-these-reasons.html&title=Despite%20Insane%20Success%2c%20Anne%20Hathaway%20Remains%20One%20Of%20The%20Least%20Popular%20Actors%20Ever%20For%20These%20Reasons" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdespite-insane-success-anne-hathaway-remains-one-of-the-least-popular-actors-ever-for-these-reasons.html&title=Despite%20Insane%20Success%2c%20Anne%20Hathaway%20Remains%20One%20Of%20The%20Least%20Popular%20Actors%20Ever%20For%20These%20Reasons" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdespite-insane-success-anne-hathaway-remains-one-of-the-least-popular-actors-ever-for-these-reasons.html&description=Despite%20Insane%20Success%2c%20Anne%20Hathaway%20Remains%20One%20Of%20The%20Least%20Popular%20Actors%20Ever%20For%20These%20Reasons" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./hallmark-s-erin-cahill-meet-the-christmas-on-cherry-lane-star.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hallmark's Erin Cahill: Meet the 'Christmas on Cherry Lane' Star">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./15-platinum-selling-artists-who-never-had-a-number-one-song.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Platinum Selling Artists Who Never Had A Number One Song">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
