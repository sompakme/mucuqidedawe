During his schooling days, it was all about partying and playing soccer - he began to settle down and embrace a different atmosphere once he worked as a bartender at the City Gardens.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Soon enough, he would muster up the courage to perform improv, and well, as they say, the rest is history. He was on the Comedy Network in the 2 AM slot at the start. His work paid off as in 1993, 'The Jon Stewart Show' came about. It all changed, however, with the inception of <a href=#>'The Daily Show'.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>How 'The Daily Show' Host Trevor Noah Amassed His Mammoth $100 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p>He started in the late '90s and finally, in 2015, he officially passed the torch to <a href=#>Trevor Noah</a>. Subsequently, he literally went off the map, that is until only the recent years.</p><p>Fans are speculating as to why he left the spotlight and if Trevor Noah had anything to do with it.</p><p>We'll also take a look at his latest project and what he is up to now.</p><h2 id=he-stated-the-noah-is-the-better-man-for-39-the-daily-show-39-gig>He Stated The Noah Is The Better Man For 'The Daily Show' Gig</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We all know by now, Stewart isn't afraid to speak the truth. In his view, the show is in better hands these days. Putting Noah aside, <a href=#>Jon admits the program always struggled in terms of finding diversity.</a> The approach in the past was a flawed one.</p><p>"Diversity for diversity's sake."</p><p>"It was, 'We don't have enough women writers, let's hire a woman. We don't have enough black writers, let's hire a black person,'" he said. "But what we realized is we weren't changing the system, we were just granting access to a club everybody should have had access to in the first place."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Everything We Know About Trevor Noah And Minka Kelly's Complicated Relationship</a></span></p><p>Alongside Howard Stern, Jon revealed that it took the show 16 years to fully commit and actually make a change for the better.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Stewart admits the show is in better hands with Noah at the helm these days.</p><p>"Because that kind of mindset, to me, because I didn't grow up in it ... it's not a part of me," he continued. "For Trevor, it's a part of him. It flows from him naturally. You don't do it because necessarily it's the right thing to do â€” it makes it better. The show is better."</p><p>Given the statement, it seems like Stewart was more than ready to step aside for the greater good. He left for five years and fans are wondering why?</p><h2 id=he-took-a-step-back-from-the-spotlight-but-continued-to-make-an-impact>He Took A Step Back From The Spotlight But Continued To Make An Impact</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One might assume that leaving for five years and coming back, isn't exactly easy... especially when assessing all the changes that took place in the world.</p><p>Alongside NY Times, Stewart described his return best, "Itâ€™s like showing up to a plane crash with a chocolate bar. Thereâ€™s tragedy everywhere, and youâ€™re like, â€˜â€˜Uh, does anybody want chocolate?â€™â€™ It feels ridiculous. But what doesnâ€™t feel ridiculous is to continue to fight for nuance and precision and solutions."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Trevor Noah Fires At Media Not Focusing On Trump Wishing Ghislaine Maxwell Luck In Epstein Case</a></span></p><p>Although he wasn't in the spotlight, Stewart was at peace, <a href=#>making an impact for the better quietly</a> and not on a grand scale. That was the refreshing part for the comedian.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Iâ€™ve taken more action in the last four or five years than I ever have in my life. Sometimes that action can speak more profoundly than a daily monologue. So I donâ€™t view myself as being out of the conversation: I view myself as not having a show. And if youâ€™re asking, Do you wish you had a show? Sometimes I do. But not the one that I had."</p><p>Seems like Stewart was dropping a hint with the statement as he's returning to TV these days under a different umbrella.</p><h2 id=stewart-39-s-returning-to-tv>Stewart's Returning To TV</h2><p>That's right, the 58-year-old is finally headed back to TV with his very own show 'The Problem With Jon Stewart'. It is set to launch in September on the AppleTV+ platform. Fans are surely excited to see the legend back on the tube, especially consistently.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is exactly what Stewart wanted, a fresh new start elsewhere. It was clear, he had no intent for a 'Daily Show' return, he knows Noah's doing a fantastic job and he wants the show to evolve under the current guard.</p><p>Let's just say it all worked out for everyone involved despite all the time that has passed.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Little-Known Facts About Trevor Noah's Comedy Career</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdn7ypuoysq56vkafBbsDApJxmmV2btrex2J6Yq2WSp7Kit4ybnJyZpaiybrvFZqurnaakv266zpqfZmc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdid-john-stewart-take-a-five-year-break-because-of-trevor-noah.html&text=Did%20John%20Stewart%20Take%20A%20Five-Year%20Break%20Because%20Of%20Trevor%20Noah%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-john-stewart-take-a-five-year-break-because-of-trevor-noah.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-john-stewart-take-a-five-year-break-because-of-trevor-noah.html&title=Did%20John%20Stewart%20Take%20A%20Five-Year%20Break%20Because%20Of%20Trevor%20Noah%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdid-john-stewart-take-a-five-year-break-because-of-trevor-noah.html&title=Did%20John%20Stewart%20Take%20A%20Five-Year%20Break%20Because%20Of%20Trevor%20Noah%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdid-john-stewart-take-a-five-year-break-because-of-trevor-noah.html&title=Did%20John%20Stewart%20Take%20A%20Five-Year%20Break%20Because%20Of%20Trevor%20Noah%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-john-stewart-take-a-five-year-break-because-of-trevor-noah.html&description=Did%20John%20Stewart%20Take%20A%20Five-Year%20Break%20Because%20Of%20Trevor%20Noah%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./does-granit-xhaka-have-a-brother-is-taulant-xhaka-related-to-granit-xhaka-what-team-does-taulant-x.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Does Granit Xhaka have a brother?
