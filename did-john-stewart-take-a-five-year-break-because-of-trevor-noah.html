During his schooling days, it was all about partying and playing soccer - he began to settle down and embrace a different atmosphere once he worked as a bartender at the City Gardens.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Soon enough, he would muster up the courage to perform improv, and well, as they say, the rest is history. He was on the Comedy Network in the 2 AM slot at the start. His work paid off as in 1993, 'The Jon Stewart Show' came about. It all changed, however, with the inception of <a href=#>'The Daily Show'.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>How 'The Daily Show' Host Trevor Noah Amassed His Mammoth $100 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p>He started in the late '90s and finally, in 2015, he officially passed the torch to <a href=#>Trevor Noah</a>. Subsequently, he literally went off the map, that is until only the recent years.</p><p>Fans are speculating as to why he left the spotlight and if Trevor Noah had anything to do with it.</p><p>We'll also take a look at his latest project and what he is up to now.</p><h2 id=he-stated-the-noah-is-the-better-man-for-39-the-daily-show-39-gig>He Stated The Noah Is The Better Man For 'The Daily Show' Gig</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We all know by now, Stewart isn't afraid to speak the truth. In his view, the show is in better hands these days. Putting Noah aside, <a href=#>Jon admits the program always struggled in terms of finding diversity.</a> The approach in the past was a flawed one.</p><p>"Diversity for diversity's sake."</p><p>"It was, 'We don't have enough women writers, let's hire a woman. We don't have enough black writers, let's hire a black person,'" he said. "But what we realized is we weren't changing the system, we were just granting access to a club everybody should have had access to in the first place."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Everything We Know About Trevor Noah And Minka Kelly's Complicated Relationship</a></span></p><p>Alongside Howard Stern, Jon revealed that it took the show 16 years to fully commit and actually make a change for the better.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Stewart admits the show is in better hands with Noah at the helm these days.</p><p>"Because that kind of mindset, to me, because I didn't grow up in it ... it's not a part of me," he continued. "For Trevor, it's a part of him. It flows from him naturally. You don't do it because necessarily it's the right thing to do — it makes it better. The show is better."</p><p>Given the statement, it seems like Stewart was more than ready to step aside for the greater good. He left for five years and fans are wondering why?</p><h2 id=he-took-a-step-back-from-the-spotlight-but-continued-to-make-an-impact>He Took A Step Back From The Spotlight But Continued To Make An Impact</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One might assume that leaving for five years and coming back, isn't exactly easy... especially when assessing all the changes that took place in the world.</p><p>Alongside NY Times, Stewart described his return best, "It’s like showing up to a plane crash with a chocolate bar. There’s tragedy everywhere, and you’re like, ‘‘Uh, does anybody want chocolate?’’ It feels ridiculous. But what doesn’t feel ridiculous is to continue to fight for nuance and precision and solutions."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Trevor Noah Fires At Media Not Focusing On Trump Wishing Ghislaine Maxwell Luck In Epstein Case</a></span></p><p>Although he wasn't in the spotlight, Stewart was at peace, <a href=#>making an impact for the better quietly</a> and not on a grand scale. That was the refreshing part for the comedian.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I’ve taken more action in the last four or five years than I ever have in my life. Sometimes that action can speak more profoundly than a daily monologue. So I don’t view myself as being out of the conversation: I view myself as not having a show. And if you’re asking, Do you wish you had a show? Sometimes I do. But not the one that I had."</p><p>Seems like Stewart was dropping a hint with the statement as he's returning to TV these days under a different umbrella.</p><h2 id=stewart-39-s-returning-to-tv>Stewart's Returning To TV</h2><p>That's right, the 58-year-old is finally headed back to TV with his very own show 'The Problem With Jon Stewart'. It is set to launch in September on the AppleTV+ platform. Fans are surely excited to see the legend back on the tube, especially consistently.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is exactly what Stewart wanted, a fresh new start elsewhere. It was clear, he had no intent for a 'Daily Show' return, he knows Noah's doing a fantastic job and he wants the show to evolve under the current guard.</p><p>Let's just say it all worked out for everyone involved despite all the time that has passed.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Little-Known Facts About Trevor Noah's Comedy Career</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdn7ypuoysq56vkafBbsDApJxmmV2btrex2J6Yq2WSp7Kit4ybnJyZpaiybrvFZqurnaakv266zpqfZmc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdid-john-stewart-take-a-five-year-break-because-of-trevor-noah.html&text=Did%20John%20Stewart%20Take%20A%20Five-Year%20Break%20Because%20Of%20Trevor%20Noah%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-john-stewart-take-a-five-year-break-because-of-trevor-noah.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-john-stewart-take-a-five-year-break-because-of-trevor-noah.html&title=Did%20John%20Stewart%20Take%20A%20Five-Year%20Break%20Because%20Of%20Trevor%20Noah%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdid-john-stewart-take-a-five-year-break-because-of-trevor-noah.html&title=Did%20John%20Stewart%20Take%20A%20Five-Year%20Break%20Because%20Of%20Trevor%20Noah%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdid-john-stewart-take-a-five-year-break-because-of-trevor-noah.html&title=Did%20John%20Stewart%20Take%20A%20Five-Year%20Break%20Because%20Of%20Trevor%20Noah%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-john-stewart-take-a-five-year-break-because-of-trevor-noah.html&description=Did%20John%20Stewart%20Take%20A%20Five-Year%20Break%20Because%20Of%20Trevor%20Noah%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./does-granit-xhaka-have-a-brother-is-taulant-xhaka-related-to-granit-xhaka-what-team-does-taulant-x.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Does Granit Xhaka have a brother?
