Brad Pitt didn't give up acting to become a beekeeper, for example, despite reports in the National Enquirer.

However, McConaughey worked prolifically throughout 2019. He was then lined up to work on a few projects in 2021, which he completed. But, in 2022, McConaughey took the year off. As such, there have been rumors in both 2020 and 2022 that McConaughey is stepping away from the glitz and glamour of Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The turning point in this rumor came when McConaughey, who did some voice acting work in 2023, was named as <strong>the newest star to join the </strong><strong>Yellowstone universe</strong>. While it has yet to be confirmed just how McConaughey will be jumping into the series, the consensus around Hollywood is that he will be starring in 2024. This is especially true with Kevin Costner leaving Yellowstone to work on other projects.</p><p>Just when McConaughey's role will be announced is unknown. But what it means is that <strong>McConaughey is not ready to give up acting.</strong> McConaughey is just being particular when it comes to how he portrays himself on the big and small screens, having the luxury of turning down roles whenever he pleases.</p><p>Source: NW, National Enquirer</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdoq61wMeermalk5i8r63UoJ%2BesV2mwqrAjJqaraGenHqzwcyoqaxn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdid-matthew-mcconaughey-quit-acting.html&text=Did%20Matthew%20McConaughey%20Quit%20Acting%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-matthew-mcconaughey-quit-acting.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-matthew-mcconaughey-quit-acting.html&title=Did%20Matthew%20McConaughey%20Quit%20Acting%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdid-matthew-mcconaughey-quit-acting.html&title=Did%20Matthew%20McConaughey%20Quit%20Acting%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdid-matthew-mcconaughey-quit-acting.html&title=Did%20Matthew%20McConaughey%20Quit%20Acting%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-matthew-mcconaughey-quit-acting.html&description=Did%20Matthew%20McConaughey%20Quit%20Acting%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-peter-thiel-built-his-multi-billion-dollar-empire.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Peter Thiel Built His Multi-Billion-Dollar Empire">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./alisyn-camerota-bio-age-husband-cnn-fox-news-salary-net-worth-twitter.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alisyn Camerota Bio, Age, Husband, CNN, Fox News, Salary, Net Worth,Twitter">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
