She is an influencer on another level. She uses social media <a href=#>(mainly Instagram, where she gets paid quite well)</a> to share glimpses of her wardrobe with followers. It might be a red carpet look, matching outfits, or a photo shoot.

A Dior stitched tongue, a Nike Swoosh in Dior Oblique jacquard, and ice outsoles that show a Dior Wings emblem on each shoe are evidence of the dual branding touches. The Dior x Air Jordan 1 High is a limited edition sneaker that was released in April 2020, and it quickly became one of the most sought-after sneakers of the year.
