The former had never spoken about their breakup until 2018 when she released <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her memoir, Lessons: My Path to a Meaningful Life</a>. There, she shared how she struggled to keep up with the Titanic star's lifestyle. "No longer numbing myself with smoking, drinking and too much work, <strong>I was becoming more and more aware of things that I'd chosen not to look at</strong>," she wrote.</p><p>"Was I alone in wanting to do some serious soul-searching while he stayed the same? In the end, unfortunately, the answer was yes."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At that time, the supermodel admitted that she "had been smoking cigarettes, drinking a bottle of wine and three mocha Frappuccinos every day" but "gave up everything in one day," thinking "<strong>if this stuff is in any way the cause of this pain in my life, it's gotta go</strong>." That included DiCaprio whom she still credited for "teaching" her something about herself.</p><p>"Everyone who crosses our path is a teacher, they come into our lives to show us something about ourselves," she explained. "And I think that's what he was. What is good versus bad? I honor him for what he was." A year later, Bündchen told Porter that she'd suffered from panic attacks during those tough times.</p><p>"<strong>When I was going through my panic attacks, I didn't even feel like I could share [them] with anyone</strong>," she told the magazine. "I thought maybe I don't have the right, everybody is going through so many difficult things in the world, and I don't have the right to feel this way. <strong>So I'd suppress it, and the more I suppressed it, the bigger it became</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gisele Bündchen's net worth is $400 million, while Leonardo DiCaprio is worth $300 million.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/screenshot-2024-05-14-at-9-33-11-pm.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Leonardo DiCaprio Nearly Lost His ‘Titanic’ Role After Making James Cameron Angry">Leonardo DiCaprio Nearly Lost His ‘Titanic’ Role After Making James Cameron Angry</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>The pair couldn't agree on how Leonardo should deliver one of the most iconic lines of the film.</p><h2 id=gisele-b-uuml-ndchen-said-she-and-tom-brady-also-quot-grew-apart-quot>Gisele Bündchen Said She And Tom Brady Also "Grew Apart"</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/instar49977391.jpg><p>In March 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bündchen revealed that she and Brady "grew apart."</a> Speaking to Vanity Fair about their shocking divorce, which was finalized in late 2022, she said: "<strong>It's tough because you imagine your life was going to be a certain way, and you did everything you could, you know?</strong>"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She continued: "I believed in fairy tales when I was a kid. I think it's beautiful to believe in that. I mean, I'm so grateful I did. You give everything you got to achieve your dream. <strong>You give a hundred percent of yourself, and it's heartbreaking when it doesn't end up the way you hoped for, and worked for, but you can only do your part</strong>." She then clarified the real cause of their divorce.</p><p>"Sometimes you grow together; sometimes you grow apart."</p><p>Bündchen confessed that they started to want different things, years into the marriage. "When I was 26 years old and he was 29 years old, we met, we wanted a family, we wanted things together," she said. "<strong>As time goes by, we realize that we just wanted different things, and now we have a choice to make</strong>."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She added: "<strong>That doesn't mean you don't love the person</strong>. It just means that in order for you to be authentic and truly live the life that you want to live, you have to have somebody who can meet you in the middle, right? It's a dance. It's a balance." At that time, people assumed it was Brady's refusal to retire from the NFL that had caused the split.</p><p>The Brazilian model thought it was a "very hurtful" accusation. "Listen, I have always cheered for him, and I would continue forever," she said. "<strong>If there's one person I want to be the happiest in the world, it's him, believe me. I want him to achieve and to conquer</strong>. I want all his dreams to come true. That's what I want, really, from the bottom of my heart."</p><p>Here's a timeline of Brady and Bündchen's relationship:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>December 2006</p></td><td><p>They met on a blind date</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>January 2007</p></td><td><p>They officially became a couple</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>February 2007</p></td><td><p>Brady's ex, Moynahan announced that she was pregnant with his son</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>August 2007</p></td><td><p>Brady's first child, John "Jack" Edward Thomas Moynahan was born</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>May 2008</p></td><td><p>Brady and Bündchen attended the Met Gala together</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>January 2009</p></td><td><p>They got engaged</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>February 2009</p></td><td><p>They got married</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>December 2009</p></td><td><p>They welcomed their first child together, Benjamin Rein Brady</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>December 2012</p></td><td><p>They had their daughter, Vivian Lake Brady</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2018</p></td><td><p>Rumors spread that Bündchen "wasn't satisfied" with her marriage with Brady</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>February 2022</p></td><td><p>Brady announced his retirement from the NFL</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>March 2022</p></td><td><p>Bündchen supported Brady as he left retirement and rejoined the NFL</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>September 2022</p></td><td><p>Sources said their marriage was "hitting a rough patch"</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>October 2022</p></td><td><p>Bündchen hired a divorce lawyer; their divorce was finalized 3 weeks later</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>February 2023</p></td><td><p>Brady announced his retirement from football</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>March 2023</p></td><td><p>Bündchen said she and Brady are still a "team" in co-parenting their kids</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>May 2024</p></td><td><p>Bündchen was "deeply disappointed" by jokes made about her during Brady's Netflix roast</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tom-brady-is-slammed-with-plastic-surgery-rumors-after_gr-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Tom Brady Is Slammed With Plastic Surgery Rumors After Fans Notice Huge Changes To His Face And Hair">Tom Brady Is Slammed With Plastic Surgery Rumors After Fans Notice Huge Changes To His Face And Hair</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Tom Brady's Roast on Netflix sparked rumors of his getting drastic plastic surgeries and a hair transplant.</p><h2 id=gisele-b-uuml-ndchen-is-quot-taking-it-slow-quot-with-her-jiu-jitsu-teacher-boyfriend-joaquim-valente>Gisele Bündchen Is "Taking It Slow" With Her Jiu-Jitsu Teacher Boyfriend Joaquim Valente</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ngnghmn.jpg><p>Two weeks after her divorce, Bündchen was spotted in Costa Rica with her new boyfriend, Joaquim Valente – the jiu-jitsu trainer mentioned in every joke at Brady's roast. The model started taking classes from Valente in December 2021. "I'm a very intense person, so when I enjoy something, I am committed," she told Dust Magazine back then.</p><p>The model initially denied being in a relationship with the Valente Brothers co-founder. "I think, at this point, unfortunately, because I'm divorced, I'm sure that they're going to try to attach me to anything," she told Vanity Fair in March 2023. But she also thanked him and his brothers for training her and her kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I'm so grateful to know all of them, because not only have they helped me and helped my kids, but they have become great friends, and Joaquim especially," said Bündchen, before <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">setting the record straight about their relationship</a>.</p><p>"He's our teacher and, most importantly, he's a person that I admire and that I trust. It's so good to have that kind of energy, to have my kids around that type of energy."</p><p>According to sources, Bündchen has been dating Valente since June 2023. "<strong>They're taking it slow</strong>," an insider told People. "They started out as great friends. She's very private about this and wanted to keep it quiet while they got to know each other." They added that the couple "come from similar backgrounds. They both left Brazil very young. <strong>Gisele's in a great space.
