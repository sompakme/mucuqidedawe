This is not an unfamiliar situation for celebrities of her stature, yet the nature of the rumor at play has amplified the attention significantly.</p><p>The rapidly spreading narrative involves the fashion magazine Vogue. This rumor has taken the digital world by storm and has sucked Justin Bieber's wife into a whirlwind of controversy. While the exact details of the story are being hotly debated across various platforms, it remains to be seen how much truth underlies it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-started-the-hailey-bieber-pregnancy-rumor>What Started The Hailey Bieber Pregnancy Rumor?</h2><p>According to SK Pop, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the ignition point of the Hailey Bieber pregnancy rumor can be traced back to a Twitter post by a user named Noah Vela</a>. This user, known for sharing memes and fabricated Vogue covers, shared an image depicting Hailey Bieber gracing the cover of the esteemed fashion magazine. The image came with a headline that suggested the model was expecting her first child with Justin Bieber.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/untitled-design-7-1.jpg><p>Accompanying the image, the user shared a supposed quote from Justin Bieber from the alleged article, stating, "Hailey and I are expecting our first child.

I fell in love effortlessly.”</p><p>However, as the rumor snowballed and attracted a wider audience, it was revealed that not only was the Vogue cover featuring Hailey Bieber a fabrication, but so too was a subsequent one featuring <a href=#>Selena Gomez, one of Justin Bieber's ex-girlfriends</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/hailey-bieber-walking-in-tribeca-2023.jpg><p>Selena Gomez wrote "glad for both of them" in a message of congratulations on the cover of the fabricated Vogue magazine, portraying Justin's ex's reaction to the news that the pregnancy rumor was genuine despite <a href=#>Senena's feuds with Hailey Bieber</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the rumors escalated, the Twitter user appeared to revel in the chaos, teasing, "About to become a meme and pop off."
