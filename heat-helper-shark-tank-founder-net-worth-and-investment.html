In this article, we will explore the founder of Heat Helper, its appearance on Shark Tank, its net worth, and more.</p><p>Heat Helper was invented by <b>Lyle Schuette</b>, an entrepreneur based in Derby, Kansas. Inspired by his wife’s struggle with laundry due to a back problem, Lyle created Heat Helper as a solution to raise the dryer and recycle the heat produced to warm the house.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Heat-Helper-Shark-Tank-1024x585.jpg alt="Heat Helper Shark Tank" title="Heat Helper Shark Tank" width=1024 height=585 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>Key Takeaways:</h3><ul><li>Heat Helper is a device that redirects warm air from a dryer into the home, reducing heating costs.</li><li><b>Lyle Schuette</b> appeared on Shark Tank seeking $100,000 for a 50% stake in his company but did not secure a deal.</li><li>The current net worth of Heat Helper is unclear.</li><li><b>Deflecto Extra Heat Dryer Saver</b> is its main competitor.</li><li>Heat Helper’s website is no longer active, but Deflecto is producing a similar product.</li></ul><h2>What is Heat Helper?</h2><p>Heat Helper is an innovative device that revolutionizes the way we utilize the heat generated by our electric laundry drying machines. By redirecting warm air from the dryer into the home, this technology offers numerous benefits, including cost savings on heating expenses and positive environmental impact.</p><p>When attached to an electric dryer, the <b>Heat Helper device</b> collects and filters the hot air that is usually vented outside. Instead of wasting this valuable heat, Heat Helper redirects it back into the house. This simple yet highly effective innovation allows homeowners to make the most of their dryer’s warmth, reducing the need for additional heating and lowering energy consumption.</p><h3>How Heat Helper Works</h3><p>The <b>Heat Helper device</b> is specifically designed to be compatible with electric dryers. It seamlessly attaches to the machine and efficiently captures the hot air it generates during the drying process. By using a filtering system, Heat Helper ensures that only clean, warm air is redirected into the home, free from any lint or contaminants.</p><p>Once the hot air is collected, Heat Helper channels it through a specially designed duct system that directs the warmth into different areas of the house. This innovative technology allows homeowners to efficiently heat specific rooms or provide overall warmth throughout their living spaces, depending on their needs.</p><h3>The Benefits of Heat Helper</h3><p>The <b>Heat Helper device</b> offers several notable benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Energy Savings:</strong> By harnessing the heat produced by the dryer and recycling it within the home, Heat Helper reduces the need for additional heating, resulting in significant energy savings.</li><li><strong>Cost Reduction:</strong> With decreased energy consumption, homeowners can expect to see a noticeable reduction in their heating bills, saving money in the long run.</li><li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> By utilizing the heat that would otherwise be wasted, Heat Helper contributes to a more sustainable lifestyle by reducing energy waste and carbon emissions.</li><li><strong>Convenience:</strong> With Heat Helper, homeowners can enjoy the warmth generated by their dryer without the need for additional heating devices or systems.</li></ul><p>Whether it’s redirecting warmth to a specific room or maintaining overall comfort throughout the house, Heat Helper’s innovative technology provides a practical and efficient solution for maximizing the benefits of your electric dryer.</p><h2>Heat Helper on Shark Tank</h2><p>On Season 3 Episode 7 of Shark Tank, <b>Lyle Schuette</b> presented his innovative product, Heat Helper, to the panel of investors. Looking for a $100,000 investment in exchange for a 50% stake in his company, Lyle aimed to showcase the value of Heat Helper and secure a deal.</p><p>During his pitch, Lyle revealed that he had already generated sales for Heat Helper. With approximately 680 units sold through his website and major retailers, the product had gained traction in the market.</p><p>As part of his valuation, Lyle set Heat Helper’s worth at $200,000, based on his asking price for the investment. The Sharks displayed interest in the product, recognizing its potential benefits and market appeal.</p><p>Unfortunately, despite garnering attention from the panel, Lyle did not receive any offers for Heat Helper. The Sharks passed on the opportunity to invest, leading to a missed deal on the show. However, Heat Helper’s appearance on Shark Tank increased its visibility and attracted significant interest from potential customers and online visitors.</p><table><tr><th>Heat Helper on Shark Tank</th><th>Investment</th><th>Valuation</th><th>Sales</th></tr><tr><td>Season 3 Episode 7</td><td>$100,000</td><td>$200,000</td><td>Approximately 680 units</td></tr></table><h2>Heat Helper Net Worth</h2><p>The current net worth of Heat Helper is unclear as of 2023.
