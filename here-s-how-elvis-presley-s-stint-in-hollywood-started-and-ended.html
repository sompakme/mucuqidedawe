The family moved to Tennessee, where he trained himself to play the guitar. While working with Sun Records, he worked part-time as a truck driver just when he released That’s All Right which became a massive hit. His dance moves and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">charisma on stage made Elvis Presley a popular entertainer amongst female audiences</a>, and he landed a record deal with RCA valued at $40,000 in 1955.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After signing the deal, Presley released albums under the record label and created new music with Rock. The genre was later labeled Rock n’ Roll, with Elvis being called its King. He gained success with mainstream music as youths loved his screen presence which also helped him land movie roles to bring his skills to the theaters. While Presley had a steady acting career, he went from music to movies to music again. Let’s take a look at why Elvis Presley made a return to music after movies.</p><h2 id=he-always-had-a-passion-for-cinema><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>He Always Had A Passion For Cinema</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Elvis Presley loved movies and the way they could influence people. From a young age, he found an interest in starring in a film. Before Tom Parker was signed on as Elvis’ manager, he contacted casting agencies with the hopes of starring the singer in a movie. The simple conversation with New York’s William Morris Agency morphed into a career for Elvis Presley in Hollywood. He actively worked in movies from 1956 to 1972.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Elvis Presley: Here Are 15 Things That Have Recently Come To Light</a></span></p><h2 id=he-wanted-to-be-a-leading-man><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>He Wanted To Be A Leading Man</span></h2><p>The legendary singer was hesitant about making his on-screen debut, but with multiple production houses willing to pay large amounts, Tom Parker negotiated lucrative deals worth millions. In 1956, he signed onto two production houses: <a href=#>20th Century Fox and Paramount</a>. Presley made his big screen debut as a supporting actor in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Love Me Tender in 1956 under Fox</a>. He made $100,000 for the role and $150,000 and $200,000 for later films.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-exploration-beyond-music><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>His Exploration Beyond Music</span></h2><p>Tom Parker helped Elvis Presley become a leading man and negotiated and renegotiated 16 contracts with different production companies to pay him for his worth. Due to his success in music, people, especially women, flocked the movie theaters to make each movie starring Elvis Presley a resounding success. Along with Paramount and 20th Century Fox, he also worked with MGM, Allied Artists, United Artists, NBC-Universal, and National General.</p><h2 id=he-defined-the-elvis-genre><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>He Defined The Elvis Genre</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With the success of Love Me Tender, production houses realized that teenage-oriented movies could also become popular. As the supporting role of a rock ‘n roll artist in his debut, Presley was cast in similar roles in the future. He plays a singer in King Creole, an ex-con pop star in Jailhouse Rock, a country boy in Wild in the Country, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">and a musical race driver in Viva Las Vegas</a>. These films introduced the Elvis genre, which featured music interludes and comedy romances.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Surprising Facts About Lisa Marie, Elvis Presley's Daughter</a></span></p><h2 id=the-war-that-changed-everything><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>The War That Changed Everything</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As the second World War raged, Elvis Presley was drafted into the US Army to serve his nation. Presley was at the peak of his career, and when he was offered to become a part of the Special Services to entertain the soldiers and live in a separate housing, Presley declined. He served as a regular soldier, earning the respect of people everywhere. Presley’s dance moves were regarded as vulgar and sexual, but the war changed people’s outlook on him.</p><h2 id=making-30-movies-in-eight-years><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Making 30 Movies In Eight Years</span></h2><p>While Tom Parker dealt with 16 contracts that made him hundreds and millions, Elvis Presley put his head down and continued making movies. While not all of his films were well-received, they were successful commercially. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elvis’ father, Vernon, detailed that his son never watched any of his movies</a>. One of the reasons was that Elvis didn’t like his projects, but they paid him handsomely.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-enjoyed-making-music-and-made-a-comeback-in-1968><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>He Enjoyed Making Music And Made A Comeback In 1968</span></h2><p><a href=#>As movies barely interested Elvis Presley</a>, music was his second home. He found solace in creating music that helped people escape reality. His music peaked in the 1950s, but the singer returned in 1968 with a television special. He played his biggest hits while simultaneously paying tribute to gospel music. The made-for-TV special returned Presley to music which he would continue to do for the rest of his life.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Elvis Presley: 10 Facts That Have Recently Surfaced</a></span></p><h2 id=he-felt-energized-while-performing><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>He Felt Energized While Performing</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With the new wave of music introduced in the 1960s, Elvis Presley found himself staggering a little with his music career. After his Comeback Special, the singer released a single Suspicious Minds, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">that peaked at No.1 on the charts</a>. He earned a following after performing shows and concerts in America. Presley began his Las Vegas Residency in 1969, which continued for the next seven years until his death in 1976.</p><p>While some believe that Elvis Presley’s Hollywood career took him away from music, it also gave some of the biggest hits of his career.
