The footwear proved to be a success in numerous countries and even made up to 60% of the company’s annual exports which is roughly around $250 million. She also teamed up with one of the largest lingerie manufacturers in Brazil called Hope in 2011 in order to launch her own brand called Gisele Bundchen Brazilian Intimates.
