The company's story started in 1913 when Mario Prada and his brother, Giuseppe, opened <a href=#>their first leather shop in Milan</a>. It was a success, and they soon became the Royal House Savoy's suppliers. Their boutique survived both world wars and was inherited by Miuccia Prada’s mother, Luisa Prada, in 1958. It wasn’t until 1977 till the journey of Prada to become a fashion empire started.</p><p><b>Miuccia Prada inherited the company from her mother in 1977 and revolutionized the company from just one boutique in 1977 to more than 600 boutiques. Today Prada has become a leading luxury brand with a valuation of more than $5 Billion.</b></p><h2 id=miuccia-s-journey-towards-inheriting-prada>Miuccia's Journey Towards Inheriting Prada</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Miuccia Prada was born on May 10, 1949, in Milan, Italy, to the Heiress of Prada, Luisa Prada, and a businessman, Luigi Bianchi. Maria went to Liceo Classico Berchet High School and received a Ph.D. in political science from the University of Milan in 1973, where her political views began to sway more and more in favor of feminism and the leftists. She joined the Italian Communist Party, often handing out fliers at rallies, and spent roughly five years training as a mime at Milan's Teatro Piccolo.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Of The Most Expensive Things Prada Has Ever Made, Ranked</a></span></p><p>At the age of 21, Miuccia started working for the Prada company and looked over the designs of the accessories. While working for Prada, she met <a href=#>her future husband, Patrizio Bertelli</a>, who owned a leather goods company. Together they envisioned the potential of Prada and planned to expand the brand, with Patrizio looking after the business side and Miuccia looking after the design side. She worked in the company for eight years before finally inheriting the company in 1978 with her husband and co-CEO Patrizio Bertelli, as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanity Fair</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-rise-of-prada-an-international-fashion-empire>The Rise Of Prada: An International Fashion Empire</h2><p>When Miuccia Prada took over the company, Prada was just a small business with only one remaining boutique. Little did anyone know that a revolution would change the whole trajectory of the company. She began trying to rejuvenate the business as a head designer alongside Bertelli. One of her first concepts was to create a line of unbranded handbags using the then-unusual Pocono nylon fabric, frequently used to create military tents. The line, which was introduced in 1979, did not, however, enjoy immediate popularity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With the development of new outlets starting in 1983 and the introduction of a shoe line in 1984, Miuccia began to extend the business internationally in the 1980s. She reintroduced her Pocono handbag line in 1985, redesigning it with a gold chain strap and the triangular signature insignia that would eventually become the company's trademark. Sales of the Pocono handbags increased due to their similarity to the more expensive leather Chanel handbags and soon were popularized among the elite class. As per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britannica</a>, the famous model and actress Jerry Hall started using Prada products during this period.</p><p>Miuccia, whose legal name used to be Maria Bianchi, had her mother's unmarried sister adopt her in the late 1980s and afterward changed her name to bear the surname Prada legally. She married Patrizio Bertelli Bertelli in 1987. The following year, she made her debut with her first ready-to-wear line, which included nylon parkas that offered clients durability without losing design. The progressive ideals of Prada were frequently reflected in her designs, which exuded a subtle glamor and a sophisticated elegance that strongly contrasted with the overt sex appeal of many of the brand's rivals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Miuccia Prada proceeded to grow the brand in the early 1990s, introducing a perfume line and various spin-off garment lines, including the more budget-friendly Miu Miu, her nickname. She and Bertelli established the nonprofit PradaMilanoarte in 1993, afterward renamed the Prada Foundation, intending to assist many emerging modern designers, including architects and artists. In 1995, Uma Thurman, a prominent Hollywood actress, donned one of Prada's gowns to the Academy Awards ceremony, catapulting the brand to international status.</p><h2 id=how-miuccia-creates-a-legacy>How Miuccia Creates A Legacy</h2><p>Prapar BV/Prada SpA), a holding company for the Prada Group of companies, was formed in 1996 by combining the operations of Prada and Bertelli. Bertelli served as the company's chief executive officer, and beginning in 2014, he shared the role with his wife. Prada Sport, an athletic cloth division of Prada, was first introduced in 1997 and later renamed Linea Rossa/Red Line.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Prada Group was <a href=#>transformed into a multibillion-dollar fashion behemoth</a> two years later by Miuccia and Bertelli, who had started a series of high-profile brand acquisitions, including the Helmut Lang and Jil Sander fashion businesses as well as a stake in fashion firms like Fendi. In 2000, Miuccia introduced a line of cosmetics, and by the start of the 21st century, the annual revenues of Prada had catapulted to $1 Billion. In 2004, Miuccia was honored with the Council of Fashion Designers of America International Award.</p><p>The secret to Miuccia Prada's success is her sales strategy and incredibly creative approach to developing clothing and accessories. Instead of limiting her collections to a predetermined and generalized definition, Miuccia looks beyond the horizon. She frequently works with eminent architects worldwide to improve the Prada store designs. She was listed as one of the 100 most powerful women in the world, according to a ranking by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>&nbsp;in 2017.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Currently, Prada is one of the leading luxury fashion brands in the world, with annual net sales of around $3.5 Billion, as per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Statista</a>. Miuccia Prada took the company from a single boutique entity to a multi-billion dollar fashion empire in 30 years, which is quite an unattainable feat. Miuccia Prada has a current net worth of $5 Billion, and she has also been awarded the title of Knight of the Grand Cross, which is the highest honorary title in Italy.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>All Of Katy Perry's Boyfriends, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Statista</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britannica</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanity Fair</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS1sMOMpqCum5Oerm680ZqbmmWdlrGmeceeqWaekai1qrvNZpymqJmnsnA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-miuccia-prada-her-luxury-fashion-empire.html&text=How%20Miuccia%20Prada%20Her%20Luxury-Fashion%20Empire&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-miuccia-prada-her-luxury-fashion-empire.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-miuccia-prada-her-luxury-fashion-empire.html&title=How%20Miuccia%20Prada%20Her%20Luxury-Fashion%20Empire" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-miuccia-prada-her-luxury-fashion-empire.html&title=How%20Miuccia%20Prada%20Her%20Luxury-Fashion%20Empire" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-miuccia-prada-her-luxury-fashion-empire.html&title=How%20Miuccia%20Prada%20Her%20Luxury-Fashion%20Empire" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-miuccia-prada-her-luxury-fashion-empire.html&description=How%20Miuccia%20Prada%20Her%20Luxury-Fashion%20Empire" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./james-mee-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="James Mee - photos">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./hilary-duff-net-worth-therichest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hilary Duff Net Worth | TheRichest">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
