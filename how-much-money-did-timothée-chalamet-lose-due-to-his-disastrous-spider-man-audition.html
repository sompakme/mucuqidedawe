In fact, some famous actors have actually <a href=#>played several comic book movie characters</a>.On top of all the actors who've become famous for playing superheroes, several movie stars have also revealed they <a href=#>auditioned for comic book movie roles they didn't get</a>. A perfect example of that is the fact that Timothée Chalamet auditioned to play Spider-Man.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Roles Showcase Timothée Chalamet's Acting Range</a></span>At this point in Chalamet's career, it is very clear that he is an extremely talented actor that many people in Hollywood want to work with. However, according to Chalamet, he auditioned to portray the <a href=#>Marvel Cinematic Universe's</a> Spider-Man and was rejected.Given that most fans love Tom Holland's version of Spidey, it is hard to imagine Chalamet in the role. However, it is fascinating to consider how much money Chalamet missed out on due to flopping his Spider-Man audition.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-timoth-eacute-e-chalamet-wasn-t-cast-as-spider-man>Why Timothée Chalamet Wasn't Cast As Spider-Man</h2><p>In 2018, Timothée Chalamet was given the Best Actor award at the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards for his work in Call Me By Your Name. During his acceptance speech, Chalamet revealed that his attempt to be cast as Spider-Man went completely awry.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Most Surprising Revelations From Timothée Chalamet's TIME Magazine Interview</a></span></p><p>“I read twice and I left sweating in a total panic.” Evidently left upset that he felt his audition went so poorly, Chalamet actually planned to go back and ask to audition again. However, a call to his agent convinced Chalamet that would be a mistake.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I called my agent, [UTA’s] Brian Swardstrom, and I said, ‘Brian, I thought about this a lot and I have to go back and knock on that door and read again,’ and he told me the story of Sean Young and how in an attempt to become Catwoman had scared everyone away when she showed up at the studio gates in costume.”</p><p>On the bright side for Chalamet, if two of the MCU's biggest stars have their way, he will join the colossal franchise in another role. After all, during an interview Tom Holland and Timothée's Dune costar, Zendaya both agreed that Chalamet would be a great choice to play Harry Osborn in the MCU.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-money-did-timoth-eacute-e-chalamet-miss-out-on-because-he-didn-t-become-spider-man>How Much Money Did Timothée Chalamet Miss Out On Because He Didn't Become Spider-Man?</h2><p>When people look back on the Marvel Cinematic Universe years from now, most fans will see this time period as the era of Spider-Man. After all, Spider-Man arguably represents the MCU's heart and Tom Holland's portrayal of the character has become immensely popular.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'MCU': Which 'Avengers' Actor Was Paid The Highest Salary?</a></span></p><p>Considering the massive amounts of money other MCU stars have gotten for their performances and Holland's current role in the franchise, it seems like he should be paid tens of millions to be Spider-Man. However, according to reports, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Holland isn't making as much money as people would think</a>.</p><p>According to celebirtynetworth.com, Tom Holland was only paid $250,000 to appear in Captain America: Civil War and his Spiderman: Homecoming salary was $500,000. That said, thanks to Spider-Man: Homecoming's stellar box office performance, Holland reportedly got a $1 million bonus.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By the time Holland starred in Avengers: Endgame, Holland's salary reportedly had been bumped up to $3 million and he typically gets $4 - 5 million for his performances these days. On top of that, according to The Sun, Holland's biggest pay date at this point was for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spider-Man: No Way Home which netted him $10 million</a>.</p><p>Based on all of those reports, it seems likely that Holland made somewhere in the $20 - $30 million range for his work to date as Spider-Man. On top of that, it is worth noting that Holland is set to play Spidey in movies in the future so that figure will rise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At first glance, that may cause some people to assume that Timothée Chalamet missed out on all of that money because he wasn't cast as Spider-Man. However, the reality isn't that simple. After all, if Chalamet was cast as Spider-Man, his schedule would have been too busy to take on many of the roles he is known for now.</p><p>Unlike Holland, there haven't been many reports about how much money Chalamet made for each of his roles. That said, there is an unconfirmed report he made $2.2 million for Dune and according to celebritynetworth.com, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chalamet has a $25 million fortune as of this writing</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Holland's reported current net worth also is $25 million, it seems likely that Chalamet lost a lot of money since he didn't become Spidey but not as much as some people may assume. That said, since Holland's Spider-Man salary is likely to get bigger and bigger in the immediate future, the amount of Timothée lost out on will get go up from here.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIympqedqWKxqrCMraCmp6SdsqZ5wqGYpZmdmsFuuM6snGaroJ6xpr6MppinZZ2kw6qx0maYrpyZqbawuo4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-much-money-did-timoth%25C3%25A9e-chalamet-lose-due-to-his-disastrous-spider-man-audition.html&text=How%20Much%20Money%20Did%20Timothe%20Chalamet%20Lose%20Due%20To%20His%20Disastrous%20Spider-Man%20Audition%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-much-money-did-timoth%25C3%25A9e-chalamet-lose-due-to-his-disastrous-spider-man-audition.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-money-did-timoth%25C3%25A9e-chalamet-lose-due-to-his-disastrous-spider-man-audition.html&title=How%20Much%20Money%20Did%20Timothe%20Chalamet%20Lose%20Due%20To%20His%20Disastrous%20Spider-Man%20Audition%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-much-money-did-timoth%25C3%25A9e-chalamet-lose-due-to-his-disastrous-spider-man-audition.html&title=How%20Much%20Money%20Did%20Timothe%20Chalamet%20Lose%20Due%20To%20His%20Disastrous%20Spider-Man%20Audition%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-money-did-timoth%25C3%25A9e-chalamet-lose-due-to-his-disastrous-spider-man-audition.html&title=How%20Much%20Money%20Did%20Timothe%20Chalamet%20Lose%20Due%20To%20His%20Disastrous%20Spider-Man%20Audition%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-much-money-did-timoth%25C3%25A9e-chalamet-lose-due-to-his-disastrous-spider-man-audition.html&description=How%20Much%20Money%20Did%20Timothe%20Chalamet%20Lose%20Due%20To%20His%20Disastrous%20Spider-Man%20Audition%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ludacris-shares-the-hardest-part-of-parenting-4-daughters.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ludacris Shares the Hardest Part of Parenting 4 Daughters">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./did-ashley-tisdale-flash-her-nipples-on-the-red-carpet.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Did Ashley Tisdale Flash Her Nipples on the Red Carpet?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
