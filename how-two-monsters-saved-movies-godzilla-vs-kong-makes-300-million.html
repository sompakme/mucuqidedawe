Known for their close proximity and confined spaces, they become one of the first institutions to be forced to close during the changing policies. AMC attempted to adjust to the situation, offering exclusive theaters that could be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rented out</a> to small groups of patrons still wanting the experience. Even a few directors stepped up, including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christopher Nolan</a>, who came out in support of theaters and released films to salvage the situation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But 2021 was slated to release some of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">most popular and highly anticipated films of the decade</a>, hoping to usher in a new era of the theater. With increased hype around films like Spider-Man: No Way Home and Eternals from the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marvel Universe</a>&nbsp;along with critically-acclaimed releases like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">No Time to Die</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mission: Impossible 7</a>, it was still a risky endeavor, with no one knowing for certain if movie theaters would come back at all, at least in the way we knew them as a cultural hub of entertainment.</p><p>Then in late March of 2021, the first big budget blockbuster hit the theaters in more than a year, a monster movie titled Godzilla Vs. Kong. Despite the waning interest and uncertainty, these two monsters crushed the box office (and HBO Max), earning <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">over $300 million worldwide</a> and solidified the existence of theaters for at least another decade. So how did these two iconic monsters overcome the odds and reign in a new era of movie going experience? Let’s take a look at the iconic history and promising future of the franchises.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Big Budget Films That Could Save Movie Theaters</a></span></p><h2 id=gigantic-origins>Gigantic Origins</h2><p>King Kong was first released in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">March of 1933</a> and starred Fay Wray as the timeless Ann Darrow. It was an instant iconic hit with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">groundbreaking special effects</a> that caused certain moviegoers to “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pass out from dread</a>”. The stop-motion effects featured in the film were animated and attributed to iconic innovator <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Willis O’Brien</a> who went on to develop some of the most groundbreaking visual effects of the time including for The Lost World and Mighty Joe Young.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The original film had created a new genre for the blockbuster, the monster movie, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the effects themselves ushered in a whole new genre of film</a> that carried on until the release of Steven Spielberg’s Jurassic Park, which made the leap from stop-motion to more mechanical and digitally created effects.</p><p>The film's franchise has continued to succeed financially, with the latest release Kong: Skull Island, earning <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">over $560 million world-wide</a> at the box office. The 2005 remake starring Jack Black and Naomi Watts also earned <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">over $560 million world-wide</a>, becoming the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fourth highest-grossing film in Universal Pictures history</a>.</p><p>Godzilla, originally created in Japan under the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Toho franchise</a>, relied on the same special effects that King Kong had used. The film succeeded as a franchise early on, earning over <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$1.6 million in 1954</a>. The Godzilla franchise has proved itself as a successful series in America as well. In 1956 an Americanized version of the film was edited and released in America, earning <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">over $2 million at the box office</a>. The film had inspired several other majorly successful blockbusters as well including the 1998 adaption by Roland Emmerich and Godzilla: King of Monsters in 2019.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Beyond the film being an American success story, the franchise also performs very well overseas. Godzilla and the MonsterVerse is now a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">billion dollar empire</a>. When the 2014 remake was released, it made <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">more overseas than in America</a>, earning over <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$104 million opening weekend</a> in its foreign markets. The Godzilla franchise is now a staple all over the world, and it comes to no surprise that when these monsters were finally able to face off, their battle became a successful hit.</p><h2 id=crushing-the-box-office>Crushing the Box Office</h2><p>With several highly anticipated films set to be released in 2021, no one could predict whether moviegoers would feel comfortable venturing into the darkness of theaters again. So they approached it from a hybrid philosophy, including both theaters and the streaming HBO Max service in their releases.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Tom & Jerry was released in February of 2021, the outcome looked bleak, having made <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">only $13 million its opening weekend</a>. But Legendary's franchise was willing to put it all on the line. Slated as a sequel to the recently successful Godzilla, King of the Monsters and Kong:&nbsp;Skull Island, both of which made <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">over $380 million worldwide</a>, the anticipation for the film generated momentous hype, resulting in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">headlines</a>, social media brackets, and consistent conversation of which monster would win.</p><p>The viral marketing that accompanied the release of the film helped it generate <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">over $50 million</a> during its US debut and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">over $70 million</a> during its China debut. With the uncertainty of the future of movie theaters at risk, the successful opening weekend not only made the film <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the highest grossing of the entire pandemic</a>, but it also shattered several record pre-pandemic as well, beating out the overall opening weekend gross of contemporary films like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Punisher: War Zone</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-future-of-theaters>The Future of Theaters</h2><p>The film has shown no signs of slowing down in terms of its success and overall gross. During the following weeks, the film <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">made an additional $200 million</a>, showcasing itself as the film that could bring audiences back into theaters. And now with the comfort level of audience goers only increasing, it is expected that films such as Mission: Impossible 7 and Spider-Man: No Way Home that will be released later this year will also outperform original expectations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So. what lies ahead for these two monsters? Legendary’s deal with the Toho franchise who owns the rights to Godzilla <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">expired in 2020,</a> leaving the future of the MonsterVerse uncertain. This is the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">36th film in the Godzilla franchise</a> and the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">12th film in the King Kong franchise</a>, making both films a legacy in moviemaking. The film’s success and demonstration of the willingness of the audience to get back to the theater may also increase the odds of a sequel or an additional film for each franchise.</p><p>With what seemed like a bleak future ahead for the theater, the two monsters, despite their division, united together, much like in the film, to take on an even bigger enemy than themselves, the pandemic. What resulted was the destruction and annihilation of the dark cloud that the pandemic cast over the entire film industry and the two legendary creatures, regardless of who you think took the win in the film, both came out on top.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>The 10 Highest Grossing Monster Movies Of All Time, Ranked</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NYDailyNews</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Decider</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CinemaBlend</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TheGuardian</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">RollingStone</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">InsideHook</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BoxOfficeMojo</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNBC</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS0sLDZoqOlmV2gvK%2BzjKyYr52UYrqwwsieqmZrYGV6rrXLpaCopl8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-two-monsters-saved-movies-godzilla-vs-kong-makes-300-million.html&text=How%20Two%20Monsters%20Saved%20Movies%3a%20Godzilla%20Vs.%20Kong%20Makes%20%24300%20Million&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-two-monsters-saved-movies-godzilla-vs-kong-makes-300-million.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-two-monsters-saved-movies-godzilla-vs-kong-makes-300-million.html&title=How%20Two%20Monsters%20Saved%20Movies%3a%20Godzilla%20Vs.%20Kong%20Makes%20%24300%20Million" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-two-monsters-saved-movies-godzilla-vs-kong-makes-300-million.html&title=How%20Two%20Monsters%20Saved%20Movies%3a%20Godzilla%20Vs.%20Kong%20Makes%20%24300%20Million" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-two-monsters-saved-movies-godzilla-vs-kong-makes-300-million.html&title=How%20Two%20Monsters%20Saved%20Movies%3a%20Godzilla%20Vs.%20Kong%20Makes%20%24300%20Million" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-two-monsters-saved-movies-godzilla-vs-kong-makes-300-million.html&description=How%20Two%20Monsters%20Saved%20Movies%3a%20Godzilla%20Vs.%20Kong%20Makes%20%24300%20Million" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jennifer-lopez-wears-white-bikini-during-st-barts-vacation.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jennifer Lopez Wears White Bikini During St. Barts Vacation">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./here-s-why-fans-won-t-see-jason-segel-in-comedies.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Here's Why Fans Won't See Jason Segel In Comedies">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
