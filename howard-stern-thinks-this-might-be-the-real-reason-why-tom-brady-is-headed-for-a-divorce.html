This has left many to guess at the reasoning for the reported divide between them. But more than anything, it has their fans heartbroken.</p><p>"I'm actually upset that Tom Brady And Gisele Bündchen are [seemingly] getting divorced," Howard Stern said to his co-host Robin Quivers, producer Gary Dell'Abate, and his audience<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> on October 5th, 2022</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"You read the statistics, 60% of marriages in America fail," Howard said, misquoting the numbers from legaljobs.io which actually has the U.S. divorce rate anywhere between 40% and 50%.</p><p>Nevertheless, Howard was hopeful that Tom and Gisele would go the distance. Not just because Howard had Tom on his show and they built a report, but also because the couple has children.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Tom Brady And Gisele Bündchen Renegotiate Their Prenup?</a></span></p><p>"I'm a divorced guy, I considered it a horror scene when I got divorced. It's not good for the kids. It's not good for anybody," Howard said before saying he feels really good about <a href=#>his second marriage to Beth Ostrosky</a>, who he's been with for over two decades.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I felt like Gisele and Tom are solid, they have a great family," Howard prior to playing a clip of Tom on his show talking about how hard he has worked on his marriage.</p><h2 id=why-tom-brady-and-gisele-b-uuml-ndchen-are-divorcing-according-to-howard-stern>Why Tom Brady And Gisele Bündchen Are Divorcing, According To Howard Stern</h2><p>During Tom Brady's 2020 interview on The Howard Stern Show, the football legend claimed that he had worked hard at fixing major issues in his marriage. According to him, these issues with Gisele pertained to his work/life balance. And it seems as though this is also the reason why they're reportedly having problems now.</p><p>But Howard Stern doesn't buy it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Would you really fall out of love with a guy because he changed his mind [about retiring]?" Howard asked both his audience and his producer Gary, who believes this to be the reason a divorce could be on the horizon.</p><p>"What I'm reading is that they really started to plan the next portion of their life and make moves and all that stuff and then he just changes his mind," Gary said in response. "I'm not sure how much he let her in on the decision."</p><p>"Boy, I wonder if you're right," Howard said before going into what he thinks is really going on.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Howard Stern Is Totally "Unable" To Leave His House, Here's The Real Reason Why</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After hearing what some of his other staffers had to say, Howard claimed there was likely something more going on beyond "the football thing". Mostly because, in theory, Gisele knows Tom and is aware that if he gave up that part of his life, he'd be giving up a big part of himself.</p><p>"Maybe they're just bored. Because Tom can get any girl he wants and Gisele can probably get any guy," Howard said. "Maybe he's got the seven-year itch. I don't know what all the factors are. He might be doing a dance right now going, 'I can't wait to f*** some girls'. You know what I mean? Who knows with this guy?"</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Howard Stern's Wife Has Very Strange Relationships With His Lovably Bizarre Staffers</a></span></p><p>"And she might be doing the same. She could be like, 'I can't wait to f*** Pete Davidson," Howard laughed. "I don't know."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Howard then continued by saying, "What's going on here is very confusing to me. I usually have a beat on this stuff. But if I was Gisele I'd be saying to myself, 'This is what my husband does. I don't want him playing another season. I don't want him getting hurt. But, at the same point, this is what he's got to do.' I wouldn't leave the dude. I wouldn't get a divorce."</p><p>While his co-host, Robin, tried to explain that Gisele could be wanting to pursue further career aspirations of her own, Howard didn't buy it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I'll tell you what the conclusion is that I just came to," Howard said to both Robin and Gary. "He's dying to f*** some girls and she's dying to f*** some guys. That's it. That's what it comes down to. I hate to [say it]. But we're animals and it's a basic thing."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirqKVdl7%2BisNhmnqKrlaGybq7Up5ucoJWjeqW11aipnJ1doa64xcSrZKGnp5a%2FpXnSrZyrpl2nsqKv06Kmp2c%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhoward-stern-thinks-this-might-be-the-real-reason-why-tom-brady-is-headed-for-a-divorce.html&text=Howard%20Stern%20Thinks%20This%20Might%20Be%20The%20Real%20Reason%20Why%20Tom%20Brady%20Is%20Headed%20For%20A%20Divorce&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhoward-stern-thinks-this-might-be-the-real-reason-why-tom-brady-is-headed-for-a-divorce.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhoward-stern-thinks-this-might-be-the-real-reason-why-tom-brady-is-headed-for-a-divorce.html&title=Howard%20Stern%20Thinks%20This%20Might%20Be%20The%20Real%20Reason%20Why%20Tom%20Brady%20Is%20Headed%20For%20A%20Divorce" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhoward-stern-thinks-this-might-be-the-real-reason-why-tom-brady-is-headed-for-a-divorce.html&title=Howard%20Stern%20Thinks%20This%20Might%20Be%20The%20Real%20Reason%20Why%20Tom%20Brady%20Is%20Headed%20For%20A%20Divorce" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhoward-stern-thinks-this-might-be-the-real-reason-why-tom-brady-is-headed-for-a-divorce.html&title=Howard%20Stern%20Thinks%20This%20Might%20Be%20The%20Real%20Reason%20Why%20Tom%20Brady%20Is%20Headed%20For%20A%20Divorce" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhoward-stern-thinks-this-might-be-the-real-reason-why-tom-brady-is-headed-for-a-divorce.html&description=Howard%20Stern%20Thinks%20This%20Might%20Be%20The%20Real%20Reason%20Why%20Tom%20Brady%20Is%20Headed%20For%20A%20Divorce" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./inside-michael-evans-behling-s-mysterious-romantic-and-personal-life.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Inside Michael Evans Behling's Mysterious Romantic And Personal Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ehren-mcghehey-net-worth-how-much-is-ehren-mcghehey-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ehren McGhehey Net Worth  How Much is Ehren McGhehey Worth?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
