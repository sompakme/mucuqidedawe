Some comments pointed out that he did pay more than stipulated in the prenup, but towards the care of his children (school, health insurance, vacation, etc.) outside the monthly child support payment. However, that did not mean the same for his ex-wife.</p><p>That’s why others believed Baumgartner was being greedy with her demands. Some fans noted that the three children the former couple shared should be the most important, at all times.</p><p>With the back-and-forth in the discussion sub-thread, nobody in the group could ultimately say the couple got what they wanted.
