He was born on December 9, 1942, to a Lithuanian immigrant, Ellis Islan and Emma, in Chicago. He was the youngest of eight children. His father was an electrician and worked for a railroad car manufacturing company, and his mother worked 50 hours a week at a Laundromat.</p><p>He grew up in the Roseland neighborhood on the South side of Chicago. At age 15, Butkus worked as a mover with his four brothers for four years. Butkus came from humble beginning. He learned to work hard and plant dedication to achieve greatness early on.</p><p>He poured tireless efforts and fierce determination into his career and soon gained success. Belonging to a blue-collar family and humble beginning, Butkus rose to fame and garnered success in both football and as an actor.</p><h2>Early education and career</h2><p>Butkus studied at the University of Illinois and played on the varsity team, Illinois Fighting Illini Football, as center and linebacker from 1962 through 1964. He was named to the 1962 All-Big Ten Conference football team.</p><p>His talent and hard work advanced his team on the path to success. In 1963 Illinois compiled an 8-1-1 record and defeated Washington in the 1964 Rose Bowl. He was announced as the team’s most valuable player and was awarded the Chicago Tribune Silver Football as the Big Ten’s most valuable player.<br>In 1964, he was unanimously named All-American.

He wore a ‘number 51′ jersey, which the Bears retired in his honor in 1994. Butkus recorded eleven solo tackles in his first game.</p><p>He intercepted five passes and recovered six opponent fumbles.

He earned his net worth from his decorated career in the NFL, sports commentary jobs, and successful acting career of over fifteen years. His first-ever contract was worth $200,000. His retirement came with four years remaining on a five-year contract with Chicago Bears, which entailed paying him $115,000 annually and medical and hospital care, which they neglected. He filed a lawsuit against the team’s doctors, whose neglect left him unable to play anymore. The lawsuit was settled, and they paid him the full value of his contract.
