The movie stars Jennifer Garner as Jenna Rink and Mark Ruffalo as Matt Flamhaff. Because of the love it has, fans were shocked when Mark Ruffalo revealed he nearly turned down the role because of one specific scene. So which scene was it?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-legacy-of-39-13-going-on-30-39>The Legacy Of '13 Going On 30'</h2><p>13 Going on 30 came out in 2004 but is still iconic nearly twenty years later. Even pop icon Ariana Grande has immense love for the movie; in her 2019 music video for Thank U, Next she portrayed Jenna Rink and recreated the iconic scene with the house and fairy dust from the movie. In 2020, Ariana wore an<a href=#> exact replica of the Jenna Rink dress</a> from the iconic Thriller scene in the movie.</p><p><a href=#>That same dress went viral on Tik Tok</a> after a user revealed that fans could buy one exactly like it on Amazon, Etsy, and a lot of other fast fashion websites.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jennifer Garner's New Movie Gives Off '13 Going on 30' Vibes</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was also seen worn by the same actress that played young Jenna Rink in the movie, Christa Allen. She started making Tik Tok videos recreating scenes from the cult classic movie. <a href=#>She racked up millions of views on these videos</a>. Overall, it is clear that the movie has never gone out of style.</p><h2 id=mark-ruffalo-almost-passed-on-39-13-going-on-30-39>Mark Ruffalo Almost Passed On '13 Going On 30'</h2><p>Mark Ruffalo's character of Matty in the movie is a fan favorite. Fans could not picture anyone else playing the role, but it almost happened! There was one scene in particular that Mark Ruffalo nearly quit because of. That scene? The icon Thriller moment.</p><p>Toward the beginning of the movie, Jenna attends her first adult party and all she knows is the '80s music scene. When the party seems dead and people are leaving she requests that the DJ play Thriller by Michael Jackson.</p><h2></h2><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why Mark Ruffalo Nearly Quit Acting</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ruffalo said "Whatever Matty was experiencing in that was actually just me. Jennifer Garner had to drag me onto the dance floor." He said it took Garner six minutes to learn the dance but six hours for him. Within the scene, Ruffalo's character totally does not want to get out on the dance floor either. It seems his character's hesitation was also his own. In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark felt he was so bad at dancing</a> that he nearly quit the movie because of it.</p><p>Garner even confirmed that this is not an exaggeration at all and said they even had to talk him into staying. He told them it just wasn't for him. Fans could not imagine the movie without him and are so glad he decided to stick it out and play the perfect Matty to Garner's Jenna Rink.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-are-jennifer-garner-and-mark-ruffalo-up-to-now>What Are Jennifer Garner And Mark Ruffalo Up To Now?</h2><p>Although they both had separate careers for a while and weren't in movies together for a long while, that changed last year. In 2021, Ruffalo posted a photo of him and Garner with a caption that referenced a scene in the movie. <a href=#>"Anyone know where to get Razzles in Canada?"</a> The remark was a reference to the iconic scene where Jenna and Matty share Razzles and reminisce on their childhood friendship. Fans freak out over this! But something even more special happened later on in the year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Garner and Ruffalo starred side by side in the new movie The Adam Project. This is the first time they have starred in something together in eighteen years. Of course, the internet freaked out over this. They play a couple in this movie as well even further ignited the nostalgic feelings from the 13 Going on 30 movie. This moment is so special for so many, even the actors.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Is Why Jennifer Garner Seems So Relatable To Fans</a></span></p><p>During an interview for the film, Ruffalo said he revisited 13 Going on 30 with his daughter. He said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“She really liked it, my little one. She’s not little anymore, but it’s such a sweet movie.”</a> Although nothing is in the works for a 13 Going on 30 sequel, it is clear fans would love that. For now, fans of the cult classic 2000s rom-com can enjoy seeing Garner and Ruffalo side by side in the new Adam Project movie. Fans can keep hoping for a sequel to see Jenna Rink and Matty back in action again, with maybe even more Razzles involved.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Jennifer Garner Spills On Ryan Reynolds' Emotional Role In ‘The Adam Project’</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmpJqqm2K%2FtrLFmqOoZZGhurC%2F02abopyeqXq1rcqeZK2glWK%2FsLjEZqCnZWFoeqi7yKeeZqeeYoBxew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmark-ruffalo-almost-passed-on-his-iconic-13-going-on-30-role.html&text=Mark%20Ruffalo%20Almost%20Passed%20On%20His%20Iconic%20%2713%20Going%20On%2030%27%20Role&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmark-ruffalo-almost-passed-on-his-iconic-13-going-on-30-role.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmark-ruffalo-almost-passed-on-his-iconic-13-going-on-30-role.html&title=Mark%20Ruffalo%20Almost%20Passed%20On%20His%20Iconic%20%2713%20Going%20On%2030%27%20Role" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmark-ruffalo-almost-passed-on-his-iconic-13-going-on-30-role.html&title=Mark%20Ruffalo%20Almost%20Passed%20On%20His%20Iconic%20%2713%20Going%20On%2030%27%20Role" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmark-ruffalo-almost-passed-on-his-iconic-13-going-on-30-role.html&title=Mark%20Ruffalo%20Almost%20Passed%20On%20His%20Iconic%20%2713%20Going%20On%2030%27%20Role" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmark-ruffalo-almost-passed-on-his-iconic-13-going-on-30-role.html&description=Mark%20Ruffalo%20Almost%20Passed%20On%20His%20Iconic%20%2713%20Going%20On%2030%27%20Role" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./monica-vaswani-boyfriend-rish-karam-age-net-worth-and-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Monica Vaswani Boyfriend Rish Karam  Age Net Worth And Family">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./major-celebrities-who-have-been-romantically-involved-with-nfl-players.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Major Celebrities Who Have Been Romantically Involved With NFL Players">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
