While Miley owes most of her fanbase to her character Miley Ray Stewart in the Disney Channel Television series Hannah Montana which gained worldwide commercial success, she has also acquired recognition for her work as a musician.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cyrus' relationship with Hemsworth was never a secret affair, nor was their split. <a href=#>Miley has always been candid about her life events, </a>whether her sexuality or her divorce from ex-beau Liam. Since <a href=#>she believes in being as open with her fans as she can, </a>a gesture that her admirers often reciprocate by praising her openness.</p><p><strong>Updated on February 2nd, 2022 by Abigail Thomas: </strong>Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth, despite their long history, were only married for a very short time. They originally dated when they were teenagers after meeting on set of The Last Song in 2009. The first of many breakups occurred in 2010, but they got back together and became engaged in 2012. They officially called off the engagement in late 2013 after previously postponing the wedding. The celebrity couple then secretly got married in 2018, but were divorcing within a year. Now, years later, Cyrus has released a song called "Flowers" in preparation for her upcoming album. The song <a href=#>seems to discuss her previous relationship with Hemsworth</a>, and fans are freaking out over the details and secrets in the song.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=liam-and-miley-met-as-teenagers>Liam And Miley Met As Teenagers</h2><p>While people know that Miley Cyrus met Liam Hemsworth on the set of the 2009 movie The Last Song, they are unaware that it was not the duo's first encounter with each other, as they had met when Hemsworth was auditioning for the movie.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Miley Cyrus And Other Musicians Who Gave Fans The Best Songs About Moving On</a></span></p><p>During an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres show in 2010, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the 7 Things singer recalled her first interaction with her then-boyfriend Liam.</a></p><p>"I met him and he opened the door for me and I was like, 'I have been in LA for three years and I don't think any guy has actually opened the door for me,'" the songstress told Ellen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"[Liam has] become my best friend in the whole wide world," Cyrus had told Parade in an interview in 2010. "I love him. He really respects me for who I am."</p><p>In another interview with the same magazine, she had claimed that Liam was 'her first serious boyfriend' despite her previous dating history with <a href=#>Nick Jonas, whom she dissed in one of her recent concerts</a>, and Justin Gaston.</p><p>Liam proposed to the Midnight Sky singer with a giant 3.5-carat Neil Lane engagement ring in 2012. The couple had posed for a silly Christmas picture in the same year with Miley's brother Trace Cyrus and mom Tish Cyrus. <a href=#>The singer has had a problematic relationship with her mother for some time</a>, but fans hoped the marriage would be just what Miley needed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Miley and Liam ended up postponing their wedding and ultimately canceling it in late 2013.

On August 22, 2019, the Slide Away singer tweeted denying infidelity to her husband. Their divorce was finalized in January 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There could be numerous reasons for the couple to divorce, none of which we can be sure about but the Midnight Sky singer opened up on the matter while promoting her seventh studio album, Plastic Hearts, on an episode of The Howard Stern Show in December 2020.</p><p>In the interview mentioned above, Miley insisted that her battles with sobriety at the time had nothing to do with her divorce and that her relationship ended only because "there was too much conflict."</p><p>While many people, peers and fans alike, were heartbroken by the news of the couple's divorce, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Liam Hemsworth's mother was one of the people who were happy about her son's decision</a>, according to a close source to The Hunger Games star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"His mom is feeling so relieved that Liam made the decision to end the relationship as his entire family, but her especially always struggled to approve Miley," the source had told Hollywood Life.</p><p>This was because Liam's family has always wanted "to see him with someone much more traditional."</p><h2 id=hemsworth-and-cyrus-moved-on-swiftly>Hemsworth And Cyrus Moved On Swiftly</h2><p>To avoid being a part of the drama, shortly after announcing his divorce Liam Hemsworth, accompanied by his elder brother Chris Hemsworth, went on a long vacation to Australia, where they were spotted on Richard Branson's Makeshift Island.</p><p>Following the split from Miley, a source told Us Weekly that Hemsworth was "open to meeting people." In October 2019, Liam was seen holding hands with an Australian actress named Maddison Brown.</p><p>However, in December 2019, sparks flew between the Australian actor and English actress Gabrielle Brooks. Hemsworth's relationship with Brooks is going strong to date.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Miley Cyrus was seen kissing Katelyn Carter during a trip to Italy in August 2019, when her split with husband Liam was announced.

There are many references to Liam throughout the song, and some fans even think <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miley is clueing in the world on Liam's cheating</a>. The song also seems to be a female remake of Bruno Mars's "When I Was Your Man," which some appreciate but <a href=#>others are not thrilled about the rewrite</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikoqSVrnqkxdGuqmakmZa6brTEpqqwp6KptW6wyK%2Bmq5uVYrCwusWloJysXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmiley-cyrus-blames-her-divorce-from-liam-hemsworth-on-one-thing.html&text=Miley%20Cyrus%20Blames%20Her%20Divorce%20From%20Liam%20Hemsworth%20On%20One%20Thing&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmiley-cyrus-blames-her-divorce-from-liam-hemsworth-on-one-thing.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmiley-cyrus-blames-her-divorce-from-liam-hemsworth-on-one-thing.html&title=Miley%20Cyrus%20Blames%20Her%20Divorce%20From%20Liam%20Hemsworth%20On%20One%20Thing" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmiley-cyrus-blames-her-divorce-from-liam-hemsworth-on-one-thing.html&title=Miley%20Cyrus%20Blames%20Her%20Divorce%20From%20Liam%20Hemsworth%20On%20One%20Thing" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmiley-cyrus-blames-her-divorce-from-liam-hemsworth-on-one-thing.html&title=Miley%20Cyrus%20Blames%20Her%20Divorce%20From%20Liam%20Hemsworth%20On%20One%20Thing" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmiley-cyrus-blames-her-divorce-from-liam-hemsworth-on-one-thing.html&description=Miley%20Cyrus%20Blames%20Her%20Divorce%20From%20Liam%20Hemsworth%20On%20One%20Thing" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./oprah-winfrey-explains-walking-away-from-russell-simmons-doc.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Oprah Winfrey Explains Walking Away From Russell Simmons Doc">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./huddle-house-franchise-cost-huddle-house-startup-costs.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Huddle House Franchise Cost  Huddle House Startup Costs">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
