Now on its 28th season, some of the series regulars have received significant notoriety and become stars in their own right. Achieving this level of fame has helped the show’s top dancers earn a healthy living, and in some cases, successfully transition into other forms of entertainment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Queens Of The Court: 10 Wealthiest Female Tennis Player of All-Time</a></span></p><p>With that in mind, we are going to take a look at the ten most financially successful pros to ever appear on Dancing with the Stars. Let’s get to it.</p><h2 id=lacey-schwimmer-1-5-million>Lacey Schwimmer ($1.5 Million)</h2><p>31-year-old Lacey Schwimmer comes from a family of professional dancers. Her father, Buddy Schwimmer, was an accomplished pro. The Redland’s California native’s brother, Benji Schwimmer, and cousin, Heidi Groskreutz, also dance for a living.</p><p>Lacey Schwimmer rose to prominence in 2007 after appearing on the 3rd season of So You Think You Can Dance. She would go on to compete in 6 seasons of Dancing with the Stars. The talented pro last appeared on season 13 with her celebrity partner Chaz Bono. Schwimmer even released her own single – a song called “Love Soundz.” Between her television appearance and music career, she is now worth an estimated $1.5 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=artem-chigvintsev-2-million>Artem Chigvintsev ($2 million)</h2><p>Russian-born dancer Artem Chigvintsev has had a very impressive career. The 37-year-old has appeared on Broadway in shows like Burn the Floor. He gained significant notoriety back in 2010 when he joined the cast of Strictly Come Dancing (a British show similar to Dancing with the Stars). He would later debut on the 19th season of DWTS and was paired with actress Lea Thompson. During this time on the series, Chigvintsev has also worked with Olympic figure skater Nancy Kerrigan and <a href=#>WWE</a> standout Nikki Bella. In fact, the Russian pro is currently dating his former partner, Nikki Bella.</p><p>At present, Chigvintsev is worth roughly $2 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=allison-holker-2-million>Allison Holker ($2 Million)</h2><p>Orem, Utah’s Allison Holker, is no stranger to the spotlight.

He has won the show an impressive six times with stars like Brooke Burke, Nicole Scherzinger, and Jennifer Gray. He is the older brother of actress and fellow dancer, Julianne Hough. The Salt Lake City, Utah native, has also won two Primetime Emmy Awards for his work as a choreographer. These days, Hough serves as a judge on the NBC show World of Dance.</p><p>Hough’s many accomplishments have helped him accumulated an impressive net worth. At press time, the Dancing with the Stars standout is reportedly worth a cool $4 million.</p><h2 id=valentin-chmerkovskiy-5-million>Valentin Chmerkovskiy ($5 million)</h2><p>Valentin Chmerkovskiy is a profesioanl dancer who was born in Odesa, Ukraine.

The 41-year-old has won numerous titles over the course of her illustrious career. However, she is arguably best known for her appearances on Dancing with the Stars. During the 13th season of the show, Smirnoff and her partner J.R. Martinez captured the Mirrorball Trophy. Besides dancing, Smirnoff has released her own fitness video and also posed for Playboy back in 2011. The DWTS standout was&nbsp; a cast member on the E! television show Famously Single.</p><p>Between dancing and her side gigs, Karina Smirnoff was accumulated around $6 million in total assets.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=maksim-chmerkovskiy-8-million>Maksim Chmerkovskiy ($8 million)</h2><p>Like his brother Valentin, Maksim Chmerkovskiy is also from Odesa, Ukraine.

The 31-year-old native of Orem, Utah’s big break came when she appeared as a pro in the 4th season of Dancing with the Stars. Hough won the first two seasons she appeared in with her partners Apollo Anton Ohno and Helio Castroneves.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unlike other members of our list, the majority of Hough’s wealth didn’t come from Dancing with the Stars.
