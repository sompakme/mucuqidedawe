But while her fellow LSU students posted selfies and laughed at reels, Dunne <a href=#>made a fortune from sponsored posts</a> and NIL (Name, Image, and Likeness) deals. According to People, <strong>Olivia Dunne has a $3.5 million net worth</strong>, and that is thanks to the hard work that she has put into promoting fashion brands and sharing her life as a college athlete. While effort doesn't always translate to a high net worth, as athlete <a href=#>Alicia Schmidt lost money after rejecting a deal</a>, Dunne will likely keep succeeding financially.</p><p>Without endorsing brands and NIL deals, it seems unlikely that Olivia Dunne could have earned so much money. After all, most college athletes aren't as wealthy as she is.

As Parade noted, she tends to represent brands in the fashion space. When interviewed on the podcast Full Send, she explained that she was given over $500,000 for one post on Instagram. While it doesn't seem like that happens all the time, that is definitely an impressive number.</p><p>Olivia Dunne grew her net worth after <strong>getting her first NIL deal in 2021 </strong>and these partnerships are why she has a $3.5 million net worth. According to The Sun, Dunne has been earning money from NIL deals since her first one, which was with Vuroi.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/olivia-dunne-put-her-net-worth-in-jeopardy-by-making-a-massive-mistake-on-instagram-deposit.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Vuroi reportedly paid the star six figures, she continued to get many different brand deals. Her autograph and photo were even on a Leaf Trading Card. While the amount that she earned from that is unknown, it must have been lucrative given her social media following. Without deals like these, Dunne wouldn't have a net worth of over $3 million and would likely be a regular college gymnast.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/how-does-olivia-dunne-get-paid_-the-truth-about-the-lsu-gymnast-and-tiktok-star-s-outlandishly-charmed-life.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Does Olivia Dunne Get Paid?
