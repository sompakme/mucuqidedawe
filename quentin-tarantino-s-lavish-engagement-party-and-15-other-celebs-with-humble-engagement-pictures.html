Experiencing a relationship in the fast lane for celebrities is something different from what others do. In fact, they are more vulnerable to falling in love due to their different relationships and the nature of their constantly changing work. They sometimes find themselves forced to date their peers, and, by chance, they get engaged or married. Dating their peers might not apply to other people who take a long time dating someone before they decide to get married. Depending on what kind of people you date, it makes people think about whether to engage in a long-term relationship before marriage or not! Some assure that dating for a long time is better than rushing into a quick engagement or marriage. Others find their soul mate as soon as they meet. However, such relationships&nbsp;are fragile, and may not last forever. Even when it continues for decades, it is exposed to a breakdown. Love is in the air when you see some of your favorite celebrities getting engaged to one another. Some have known each other for a very long time, and others have just met. Some have simple engagement rings, and other engagement rings are extremely lavish. When famous people get engaged, the world takes notice. We scoured the Internet and found Scotty McCreery's and 15 other celebrity engagement photos that will blow your mind away.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=scotty-mccreery-popped-the-question-to-his-longtime-girlfriend-gabi-dugal>Scotty McCreery popped the question to his longtime girlfriend Gabi Dugal</h2><p>Last September, American Idol winner&nbsp;Scotty McCreery proposed to his girlfriend Gabi Dugal while they were hiking on the trail near Grandfather Mountain in North Carolina. Engagement photos are something fascinating. Such images remind married women of the time when they were on their way to be wives. What days! McCreery invited her to go hiking before the pair had a photoshoot&nbsp;following their engagement.&nbsp;Wearing his favorite blue sweater and jeans, the 24-year-old McCreery and his fiancée Dugal asked&nbsp;Amber Wilson Beasley and Krista Fournier of Six Foot Photography to shoot the special pictures. Dugal, who was working as a nurse at Duke University Hospital, agreed&nbsp;to marry the country singer sometime in 2018.</p><h2 id=holly-marie-combs-amp-mike>Holly Marie Combs & Mike</h2><p>On September 3rd, Combs was proud to&nbsp;reveal that her boyfriend Mike had become her beloved fiancé. Feeling happier than usual, she shared a photo of her amazing, oval diamond engagement ring with her friends on Instagram. To get her friends more excited, she captioned the photo with a short phrase: "Yes. Just yes." Surprisingly, the photo gained more than 43,000 likes. The Pretty Little Liars actress has never spoken to anyone about Mike and so many of her friends could not recognize him as her fiancé. Unfortunately, Combs also experienced divorce in the past. In fact, this&nbsp;is the third marriage for her. Her second husband, David Donoho, divorced her after seven years in 2011. The former couple share three kids: Finley, 13, Riley, 10, and Kelley, 8.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=miles-teller-amp-keleigh-sperry>Miles Teller & Keleigh Sperry</h2><p>It seems that Miles Teller's wedding is taking place shortly. The 30-year-old Whiplash star turned up as a suitor for his girlfriend Keleigh Sperry, the 24-year-old model, while they both were on a safari in South Africa. Sperry's sister, Christie, posted some photos of her sister's engagement party on Instagram. The couple has been dating since 2013 until a little while ago when they vacationed in Seychelles and then headed to South Africa. Sperry shared photos from their visit to the Madikwe Game Reserve. What was amazing about Teller and Sperry's relationship was that they&nbsp;stayed together despite the ups and downs. Even when Teller got arrested for public intoxication in California in June, the couple stayed together. There is nothing that can separate this couple.</p><h2 id=terry-farrell-amp-adam-nimoy>Terry Farrell & Adam Nimoy</h2><p>Here is some news that will delight Star Trek fans around the world. It is about Adam Nimoy, television director, and son of the iconic Leonard Nimoy, who got engaged to Terry Farrell, the Deep Space Nine actress. Trekkie Scott Mantz, a movie critic, reported the developments that dominated the couple's relationship in an interesting tweet. Farrell has a son from an earlier marriage, and Nimoy, who is 60, has two kids with his ex-wife. In September 2014, Adam Nimoy and his father Leonard started to work on what would become the Love of Spock. But unfortunately, Leonard died at the beginning of February 27th, 2015 after suffering from a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In 2016, Adam Nimoy released a headline indicating that he was making a documentary dedicated to his father's memory. In fact, his father's portrayal of Mr. Spock (as the logical and lovable half-human, half-Vulcan) could get closer to the hearts of audiences in the late 1960s. In July 2016, Adam Nimoy stated, “When I originally approached my dad about making the documentary it was just going to be Spock-centric all the way, from beginning to end. It was really supposed to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Star Trek.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=letoya-luckett-amp-tommicus-walker>LeToya Luckett & Tommicus Walker</h2><p>LeToya Luckett is on the moon again! Sharing a startling selfie of her jaw-dropping engagement ring on Instagram, the R&B singer expressed her happiness about her engagement to Texas businessman Tommicus Walker. “I said, ‘Yes yeeeesssss' on his Birthday!!" Luckett got married to Rob Hillman in January 2016. But they broke up two months later, and they declared their divorce last spring. Luckett stated with a tinge of both happiness and sadness on The Breakfast Club in May 2017, "Anytime you open up and allow yourself to love and love hard, that's the risk you take of it possibly not working out. And although we really did love and care for each other, it just didn't turn out the way we wanted it to." Actually, Luckett was one of the original four members of Destiny's Child and sang on hits such as "Say My Name"&nbsp;and "Jumpin’ Jumpin''. One night, Luckett was caught by an astonishing surprise when Walker knelt in front of her before their friends and family, and even his young daughter, seeking her satisfaction and consent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tiera-skovbye-amp-jameson-parker>Tiera Skovbye & Jameson Parker</h2><p>The actress's new love! Tiera Skovbye, one of the renowned actresses of Riverdale, shared the announcement on Instagram, stating that she got engaged to her boyfriend Jameson Parker. She mentioned, "This weekend was something out of a dream. The love of my life surprised the crap out of me and asked me to marry him in his childhood bedroom (not planned, I'm really hard to surprise)." She also stated, "We got to spend the rest of the weekend hanging out on the lake with both of our families, and it was absolutely wonderful. I'm really happy." After their engagement, Skovbye, 22, shared a lot of photos of their happy party. Yet she shared a fairly silly image (at least for many of their friends) of them both holding up their fingers with the engagement ring. Despite this, Skovbye posted a nice snapshot of her fiancé giving her a nice kiss on the forehead when she put her hand on his chest delicately.</p><h2 id=josh-abbott-amp-taylor-parnell>Josh Abbott & Taylor Parnell</h2><p>Abbott is the happiest guy in the world! Josh Abbott has another reason to celebrate! While Josh Abbott (the Josh Abbott Band frontman) was happy celebrating his engagement to Taylor Parnell, their 11-month-old daughter was the first to pose urging queries. His daughter had an adorable pink outfit that read, “Mommy will you marry Daddy?” What was more surprising was that he put a gorgeous ring next to their daughter. Abbott celebrated his 37th birthday on the same day he celebrated his engagement to his girlfriend. He tweeted it and posted two photos of Emery. Other photos that he posted showed that they were the happiest couple in the world. As for Parnell, she celebrated her 25th birthday. She was so happy that she announced their engagement news two hours before Abbott's tweets.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=meryl-davis-amp-fedor-andreev>Meryl Davis & Fedor Andreev</h2><p>The year 2018 is&nbsp;very special for Meryl Davis, who is supposed to defend her Olympic gold medal with her skating partner Charlie White. In 2018, she will be ready to have another exciting event: her wedding. Her fans were&nbsp;excited to hear&nbsp;that the Olympic athlete finally announced her engagement to Fedor Andreev, a popular former skater, and son of her coach, Marina Zoueva.&nbsp;She posted a photo of her wonderful canary yellow diamond ring on Instagram, and&nbsp;wrote 7/13/17, which was the day they got engaged. In fact, Meryl Davis and her fiancé made another huge step in their relationship when they announced that they bought a mini sheepadoodle named Bilbo Baggins.</p><h2 id=patton-oswalt-amp-meredith-salenger>Patton Oswalt & Meredith Salenger</h2><p>The comedian's representative said to an audience that he and Meredith Salenger, an actress, are going down the aisle. What did he actually mean? He was joking about the proposal in one of his tweets saying, "I put the ring in a marzipan Slave I replica and said, ‘Will you be my Padawan of Love? She maced me but said yes later.” In July, Oswalt and Salenger showed off her ring when they were attending the movie Baby Driver in Los Angeles. Nearly 15 months after his wife's death, dying in her sleep, the news of Oswalt and Salenger getting married was announced. McNamara left him with an 8-year-old daughter, Alice Rigney. He was patiently caring for his only daughter, feeling a big sense of grief. Yet, his relationship with Salenger, and posting their pictures on Instagram relieved him from much of the pain. They got married in 2017.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=maren-morris-amp-ryan-hurd>Maren Morris & Ryan Hurd</h2><p>Maren Morris fills Ryan Hurd's heart with joy! Maren, 27, showed off her happiness with her engagement to Ryan Hurd, 32, when she posted many photos of her engagement ring. Morris is the famous "My Church" singer and songwriter. Her photos showed her holding a Corona Light while placing her hand on Hurd's leg, and they both stared into each other's eyes. Hurd's most recent Instagram post was a snapshot of him and Morris on a boat ride with the date of the proposal, July 3, as the caption. Morris said, "We had been friends for only a couple of years, but there was always this writing chemistry in the room, and eventually, the timing of it was undeniable. We had such a foundation built off of writing so many songs over the years that we were like, why are we avoiding this?"</p><h2 id=katie-cassidy-amp-matthew-rodgers>Katie Cassidy & Matthew Rodgers</h2><p>Katie Cassidy is waiting for wedding bells! The 30-year-old actress spoke publicly about her engagement to Matthew Rodgers earlier in 2017. Moreover, she posted a nice photo of them on Instagram. Along with the shot, Cassidy wrote happily, “I can't wait to spend forever with you my darling!! I'm the luckiest girl in the whole world.” To her fans' surprise, she showed off her new love in front of millions of people! She exposed her matchless, sparkling diamond engagement ring in one of her photos. Amazing! On his part, Rodgers shared a romantic photo of his hand intertwined with Cassidy's, showing off her shiny new ring on Instagram. He also announced that he and his fiancée are going on vacation to the East African island of Mauritius.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=marcus-grodd-amp-ally-lutar>Marcus Grodd & Ally Lutar</h2><p>A Bachelor Nation's star has discovered his match!

Grodd proposed to the British Columbia native at the picturesque Lynn Valley Canyon in Vancouver. He stated, “I was trying to find the perfect location to propose. I wanted her to be completely surprised.” Grodd accompanied Lutar on a mountainside hike and knelt in front of her, requesting her hand. He said, “It was truly the most incredible day of our lives.” Lutar currently owns a marketing and staffing agency that is located in Newport Beach California. He said he remembers the feeling of seeing his fiancé for the very first time: "That woman is going to be my wife. She is so strong, and confident and I'm completely drawn to her."</p><h2 id=michelle-branch-amp-patrick-carney>Michelle Branch & Patrick Carney</h2><p>The couple met at a Grammys party which was held in February 2015 in LA. It's the same year Michelle weathered a divorce from Teddy Landau. Soon, Branch and Carney started working together until they released Hopeless Romantic, Branch's latest album when they fell in love. In April, she declared her relationship with Carney who was the ex-husband of Emily Ward.&nbsp;On Branch's 34th birthday, the musician had a party, but she didn't know that it was a double celebration. The celebration came with a birthday cake and a proposal! The Black Keys drummer and the musician boyfriend, Patrick Carney, made his proposal over dessert. She said, "Thank you for all the birthday love and wishes. Last night, right before I blew out my candles, Patrick asked me to marry him and then I had nothing left to wish for… 34 might be the best year yet."

Tarantino was promoting his film Inglourious Basterds in 2009 in Israel when he met the 33-year-old Pick. They had a relationship until he proposed in LA in the summer of 2017. The news came after eight months after his retirement announcement.

Costabile shared on Instagram and Twitter, "I knew I wanted to ask this girl to marry me the day she walked into the green screen for an interview almost four years ago.
