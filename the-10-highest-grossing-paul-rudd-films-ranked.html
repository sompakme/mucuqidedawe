Born in 1969, the New Jersey native has starred or been featured in over 68 movies since the beginning of his career in 1992 in a few television dramas, His debut came in 1994 in the comedy Clueless alongside Alicia Silverstone. From thereon, Rudd has appeared in numerous box office heavy hitters such as The 40-Year-Old Virgin. Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers and successful animations such as The Sausage Party. In celebration of his work as a Hollywood actor, here are 10 of the highest-grossing Paul Rudd movies.</p><h2 id=avengers-end-game>Avengers: End Game</h2><p>In 2019, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Avengers: Endgame</a> was undoubtedly the highest-selling box office movie of the year, hands down! Grossing $2.797 billion against a $400 million budget was truly a milestone for the Marvel Studios production company. The film features many of the popular characters throughout the entire Marvel Comics series such as Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Thanos (Josh Brolin), and Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd). Together, the heroes must band together and go back in time to retrieve the Infinity Stones in order to stop Thanos from destroying half the universe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=avengers-infinity-war>Avengers: Infinity War</h2><p>So, in 2018 Avengers: Infinity War set the foundation with a cast of more or less the same characters and actors. In this movie series, Thanos (Josh Brolin) begins his quest to find the Infinity Stones and subsequently destroy half of all life in the universe. Thanos executes a number of characters in the movie, including Heimdall (Idris Elba) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) while he throws Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) back to earth where he reverts to himself as Bruce Banner. Together with the Guardians of The Galaxy, headed by Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), as well as Iron Man (Robert Downey) and many more the superheroes such as Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and War Machine (Don Cheadle); they attempt to stop Thanos from executing his plan.</p><h2 id=captain-america-civil-war>Captain America: Civil War</h2><p>As long as there is a Marvel Comic movie to be produced, then the legendary team of actors will be ready to reprise their roles, as they did in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Avengers: Infinity War</a>. The A-team that is usually banded together against their enemies in combat is divided after several Wakandan humanitarian workers are killed by Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) when she uses her telekinetic powers to divert an explosion meant to kill Captain America (Chris Evans), set off by Brock Rumlow (Frank Grillo). This causes the U.S Secretary of State, Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) to establish a UN panel called Sokovia Accords to oversee the superhero team. While Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is in support of the panel's delegation, Captain America doesn't support the judgment of politicians over his own, which causes a rift between the heroes. Meanwhile, they must stop a brainwashing terrorist named Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) before he brainwashes and kills other super-soldiers. The film grossed $2.048 billion at the global box office, just behind Avengers: Endgame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ant-man-and-the-wasp>Ant-Man And The Wasp</h2><p>It may not be the grandest net worth in the world, like that of Jack Nicholson's $150 million, but $70 million is still a great amount of wealth gotten by Paul Rudd. The year 2018 was a super-successful year for Rudd, being that he starred in the billion-dollar superhero film, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Avengers: Infinity War</a>, as well as Ant-Man & The Wasp, which grossed a healthy $623 million at the international box office. The film was released a few months after Avengers: Infinity War and follows Scott Lang/Ant-Man, who is on house arrest for his involvement in the violation of the Sokavia Accords. Simultaneously, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Hope van Dyne, also known as the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), work together to rescue Hank's wife, Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) from a Quantum Realm she was trapped in 1987. So Ant-Man and The Wasp join forces to save her mother and Hank's long-lost wife.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=night-at-the-museum>Night At The Museum</h2><p>Paul Rudd has rarely ever played the role of an antagonist in any of his movies. But in the first release of Night at the Museum in 2006, while he still didn't embody an outright villain, his role definitely wasn't the viewer's favorite. As the movie goes, Larry Daley's (Ben Stiller) ex-wife, Erica Daley (Kim Raver), divorces him because of his job instability and, as a result, financial straits. She rebounds with the more financially responsible Don (Paul Rudd), who Larry is afraid that their son, Nick, will admire more than him. In an attempt to approve his financial situation, he applies for a night security guard position at the Museum of Natural History, where he learns of the supernatural animation of the museum's artifacts which occurs at night. The film grossed $579 million for its first installment and only went up from there!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>Pineapple Productions: The 10 Highest-Grossing Movies Produced By Seth Rogan</a></strong></span></p><h2 id=ant-man>Ant-Man</h2><p>The year 2015 marked the coming-out party for the Marvel Comic superhero, Ant-Man, played by Paul Rudd. The film tells the story of how the Ant-Man came to be through the scientific experiment of scientist Hank Pym's (Michael Douglas) Yellowjacket shrinking technology, which he created independently from S.H.I.E.L.D. after discovering their attempt to back-engineer his Ant-man technology. Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is a "good thief" who has been released from prison and bunks by his old cellmate, Luis (Michael Pena). Motivated by the verbal scolding of his ex-wife, Maggie (Judy Greer) for not paying child support to their daughter, Cassie, he cracks open a safe and steals what he believes is a motorcycle jacket. He tries it on, not knowing it's the Yellowjacket belonging to Hank Pym and shrinks down to ant size. Scared by the experience, he returns the jacket to the house it was stolen from, only to be arrested when leaving. Pym then visits Lang and convinces him to become the new Ant-Man, and so the hero is born. The film grossed $518 million globally.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=monsters-vs-aliens>Monsters Vs. Aliens</h2><p>Produced by DreamWorks Animation, Monsters vs. Aliens was released in 2009 as a computer-animated monster comedy film. The character's voiceovers were done by a similar cast of buddy actors that brought you The Sausage Party, namely Seth Rogan and Paul Rudd. The animation film follows Susan Murphy (Reese Witherspoon), a modest California woman who is moments away from marrying news weatherman, Derek Dietl (Paul Rudd), who gets struck by a meteorite coming from a destroyed planet. The radiation from the meteorite causes her to glow green and grow to almost 50 feet tall. Her abnormality attracts the attention of the U.S. military, who seizes her and lock her away with other monster inmates, namely Dr. Cockroach Ph.D. (Hugh Laurie), B.O.B. (Seth Rogan), The Missing Link (Will Arnett), and Insectosaurus (Conrad Vernon). Together, they must save earth from an alien overlord named Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson). The film grossed $381 million against a $175 million budget.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=knocked-up>Knocked Up</h2><p>The dynamic duo of Paul Rudd and Seth Rogan were at it again in the 2007 romantic comedy, Knocked Up. When a night of celebration following the promotion of Los Angeles news reporter, Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) leads to a one-night stand with a Canadian immigrant, Ben Stone (Seth Rogan) who lives on injury compensations, they realize they're complete opposites, and part ways. However, when Alison experiences symptoms of morning sickness during an E! News interview with James Franco, she confirms she is pregnant after several pregnancy tests and reaches out to inform Ben. The two decide to look past their differences and try to be a family, but Alison's sister Debbie (Leslie Mann) and her husband Pete's (Paul Rudd) relationship give her second thoughts. The film grossed $219 million at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ghostbusters-afterlife>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</h2><p>They say there's nothing like the original version of a thing, no matter how many duplicates or sequels come along. This is true in the case of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghostbusters: Afterlife,</a> released in 2021. The original Ghostbusters was released in 1984, followed by Ghostbusters 2 released in 1989, both films starring Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Sigourney Weaver, Ernie Hudson, and Rick Moranis. Even after 33 years since their last time on screen together with Ghostbuster 2, the entire gang appeared once again in Ghostbusters: Afterlife with Paul Rudd, Carrie Coon, and Finn Wolfhard as the leading cast. However, despite the original casts' return to the big screen, the film only grossed $196.7 million at the box office.</p><h2 id=the-40-year-old-virgin>The 40-Year-Old Virgin</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There's nothing more embarrassing than being constantly taunted by your much younger co-workers for a personal issue they had no business knowing of, to begin with. This was the plight of Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell), a 40-year-old introvert working as a stock supervisor at an electronic store. Besides work, he passes his leisure time playing with an action figure collection and playing video games in his apartment. However, when it's revealed to his co-workers David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco), and Cal (Seth Rogan) that he's a virgin during a late-night poker game, they go all out to get him laid. Their attempts and advice only serve to confuse him further, until he finds love with a single mother of three, Trish Piedmont (Catherine Keener). The film remains a hilarious modern classic, grossing $176.2 million internationally.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>This Is Paul Rudd's Net Worth As Of 2022</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NY Times</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">RogerEbert.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Collider</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMamdmoJmctaa%2F02aeq6ejqLavs4ypmK6kXafCpbCMn6ClpaNiv6K6yp6baA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-10-highest-grossing-paul-rudd-films-ranked.html&text=The%2010%20Highest-Grossing%20Paul%20Rudd%20Films%2c%20Ranked&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-10-highest-grossing-paul-rudd-films-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-10-highest-grossing-paul-rudd-films-ranked.html&title=The%2010%20Highest-Grossing%20Paul%20Rudd%20Films%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-10-highest-grossing-paul-rudd-films-ranked.html&title=The%2010%20Highest-Grossing%20Paul%20Rudd%20Films%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-10-highest-grossing-paul-rudd-films-ranked.html&title=The%2010%20Highest-Grossing%20Paul%20Rudd%20Films%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-10-highest-grossing-paul-rudd-films-ranked.html&description=The%2010%20Highest-Grossing%20Paul%20Rudd%20Films%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tony-khan-comments-on-streaks-ending-for-the-undertaker-and-john-cena.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tony Khan Comments On Streaks Ending For The Undertaker And John Cena">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ree-drummond-children-meet-ree-drummond-s-kids-alex-drummond-paige-drummond-bryce-drummond-and.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ree Drummond Children: Meet Ree Drummonds Kids Alex Drummond, Paige Drummond, Bryce Drummond, And">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
