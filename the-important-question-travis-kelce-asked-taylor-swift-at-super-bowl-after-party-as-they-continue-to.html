But that's about to change.</p><p><strong>Taylor Swift is now embarking on another leg of her Eras tour, and Travis will be joining her on the journey.</strong> "After the Super Bowl, Travis will be joining Taylor on her tour and traveling with her," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source shared a few days ago</a>.
