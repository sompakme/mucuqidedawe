She and her family entertained Mob Wives fans almost every time they were on screen after they debuted. Big Ang was so popular she even got her own spin-offs, Big Ang and Miami Monkey. Before she tragically died of lung cancer in 2016, Ang gave some intense, quotable, and hilarious moments for fans to enjoy.</p><h3 id=update-2023-06-26-19-09-est-by-lane-vasquez>UPDATE: 2023/06/26 19:09 EST BY LANE VASQUEZ</h3><p><strong>"Big Ang" Angela Raiola Lived A Big Life On Mob Wives</strong></p><p>Angela Raiola's time on Mob Wives is still iconic today, as the reality star known as Big Ang worked hard to keep her fellow wives on track, tried to guide her son toward the right path, and even worked on some self-reflection in her marriage to partner Neil Murphy. Angela Raiola passed away in 2016, but her big moments from Mob Wives live on today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-mob-wives-got-real-about-mob-wife-code><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>The Mob Wives Got Real About Mob Wife Code</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/angela-big-ang-raiola-at-a-vh1-event-in-2011.jpg><p>In a video that was a supercut of the cast telling fans what it means to be a Mob Wife, one word came up constantly: loyalty. Every wife and mother gave their candid answer about what loyalty meant to them, and for Big Ang, it meant people should, "Watch out!" when anyone starts talking about her family.</p><p>"Once I get started, I don't stop." In the following <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">clips of Mob Wives</a>, the women get into intense fistfights because of what each other says about their families, Ang chimes in with her two cents, "This is why you don't talk about families. Look at the outcome."</p><p>Ang also reiterates in the video that Mob Wives are supposed to have each other's backs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=angela-raiola-had-a-heart-attack-scare><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Angela Raiola Had A Heart Attack Scare</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/angela-big-ang-raiola.jpg><p>Big Ang's cancer battle was not the only time she fell victim to a terrifying health scare. In the second episode of her spin-off reality show Big Ang, Ang has a heart attack scare.</p><p>After recovering from the incident, she tried to put herself on the path to a healthier life. She promised to quit drinking and smoking, but despite her best efforts Ang still succumbed to cancer at the age of 55.</p><h2 id=big-ang-always-wanted-unity-among-the-wives><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Big Ang Always Wanted Unity Among The Wives</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/angela-railoa-with-other-mob-wives-cast-members-on-the-beach.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ang did her best to keep the wives united while she was still alive, despite the times she got caught up in the drama too. It is also no secret that Ang, and most of the wives, love to party.</p><p>To celebrate Drita and Karen making up with each other, Ang invites the wives and the kids to Delmonicos, a famous steak house.</p><p>Tensions mounted when some wives indicated that the sit-down did not actually patch things up, but when it was Drita revealed she was messing with everyone the whole party got a good laugh.</p><h2 id=when-she-broke-down-about-aj><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>When She Broke Down About AJ</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/big-ang-on-dr-oz.jpg><p>Part of being a Mob Wife, according to "the code" is an endearing and unquestionable love for family.

Ang, <a href=#>like some of the biggest stars in Hollywood</a>, turned to a psychic for help. According to Ang, this was far from the only time she had done so. "I visit psychics a lot.
