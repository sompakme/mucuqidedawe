He's worked his way up to host some of the most well-known TV programs out there, and despite some drama in his past, he's been relatively scandal-free over the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ryan's diverse income streams helped him amass $450 million, and while being in the entertainment industry seems like a good time, it's not necessarily easy work. Seacrest has been on the grind for decades, and he does everything from acting to producing to hosting. But he also has a soft side, donating some of his funds to his own charity foundation.</p><p>With a salary this large, it's hard to imagine anything you couldn't afford, but what exactly does this famous host make and spend this kind of cash?</p><h2 id=jewelry-and-presents-for-his-lady-friends>Jewelry And Presents For His Lady Friends</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Julianne-Hough-and-Ryan-Seacrest.jpg><p>Years ago, Ryan Seacrest dated Julianne Hough, and the pair were together for almost three years. But right before they split up, news surfaced that Julianne had apparently been robbed. Over $100K worth of jewelry was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly stolen</a> from her vehicle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Contestant Scott MacIntyre Actually Defended Ryan Seacrest's Worst Moment On American Idol</a></span></p><p>The jewelry, which included multiple pieces but most notably a watch valued at $50K, consisted of gifts from Ryan to his then-girlfriend. Clearly, Ryan has nothing against buying his flames fancy things, even if they do wind up stolen (why wasn't the collection in a safe, Julianne?!).</p><p>Today, however, Seacrest is dating a model named Aubrey Page, and he's not skimping on gifts. In fact, in the summer of 2023, Seacrest took Page with him on a luxurious vacation to Italy. And given his likely non-existent budget, chances are he treated her to lots of great things on their trip, including what appears to be a yacht excursion, according to Page's Instagram.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-career-as-a-producer-and-television-host>His Career As A Producer And Television Host</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/kuwtk-ryan-seacrest.jpeg><p>Years ago, Seacrest established his own production company, so he likely invested some funds into that venture. As fans know, however, Seacrest is responsible for producing 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians,' which likely earned its keep within the first few seasons at most.</p><p>At the time, fans wondered how Ryan planned to keep his earnings up (not that he needed more cash flow) since the series was coming to an end.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, Seacrest has also struck various deals on behalf of his production company, so while some funds were tied up in that endeavor (and not all of them were Ryan's; he does have investors), money has continued moving both ways.</p><p>When it comes to hosting, no one does it quite like Seacrest. For one, he served as a co-host for 'Live with Kelly and Ryan' (as well as an executive producer), and was the sole host for shows like <a href=#>'American Idol,'</a> 'On-Air With Ryan Seacrest,' and more. And, in one of his newest business ventures, in 2023, Seacrest was selected to be <a href=#>the new host of the long-running game show, 'Wheel of Fortune,'</a> replacing Pat Sajak.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Vanna White Threatens To Leave ‘Wheel of Fortune’ After Making Less Than Half Her Co-Host’s Salary For 2 Decades</a></span></p><h2 id=philanthropic-activities-ryan-likes-to-donate>Philanthropic Activities: Ryan Likes To Donate</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For celebrities with millions of dollars, philanthropy becomes something of a hobby. Though it's almost sickening just how much cash one person can sit on after they've really made it big, Ryan Seacrest makes a point of giving back to various charitable organizations.</p><p>Not only has he launched his own nonprofit, the Ryan Seacrest Foundation, which supports children's hospitals all over the US, but Ryan also serves on various boards for multiple non-profits.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Ryan Seacrest Stunned Hollywood When He Turned Down This Popular Game Show, And Picked American Idol Instead</a></span></p><p>Look to the Stars claims that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seacrest also supports</a> a long list of charities, including food programs, the Red Cross, cancer funds, and AIDS support organizations. In 2020 it was reported that the host donated $1 million to relief efforts in Los Angeles and New York during the Coronavirus pandemic. And more recently, in June 2023, The Ryan Seacrest Foundation <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">partnered with Le Bonheur Children’s Hospital</a> to build a 1,275-square-foot broadcast media center.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=creature-comforts-all-around-the-house-and-beyond>Creature Comforts, All Around The House (And Beyond)</h2><p>From Ryan's Instagram, fans can see that there are a few pricey things he enjoys. For one? Food, and a lot of it; Ryan is a big fan of steak, filet mignon, shrimp, and fondue, among other delicacies. So he's obviously not going to skimp on dining in or out.</p><p>In terms of living, Seacrest is no stranger to not-so-humble abodes. While he's known to live in New York City near the studios for Live! With Ryan and Kelly (which he reportedly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">announced he'd be leaving in February 2023</a>), he also has a home in Los Angeles. However, According to dirt.com, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seacrest sold his LA house for $51 million</a>. And, believe it or not, according to the report, the home was originally listed for $85 million back in 2020! The home was previously owned but a long line of celebs, including Joan Collins and <a href=#>Ellen DeGeneres</a> and her wife, Portia de Rossi.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ryan has also been spotted behind the wheel of various vehicles, including a Land Rover, Bentley, and more. He has even been rumored to own an Aston Martin that typically sells for a whopping $203,000. But that's not all that much when you compare it to his $450 million net worth!</p><h2 id=brand-endorsements-that-are-keeping-his-bank-account-and-gut-healthy>Brand Endorsements That Are Keeping His Bank Account (And Gut) Healthy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/copy-of-untitled-10-1.jpg><p>While Seacrest's hosting gigs definitely help him sustain his lavish lifestyle, he also has brand endorsements that help keep that cash flow going. In 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he announced his partnership with Health-Ade</a>, the brilliant minds behind the popular line of kombucha beverages, according to a report by World Tea News. The company advocates the cutting out of sugary beverages, replacing them with more gut-healthy alternatives, like their drinks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I've been a longtime fan of Health-Ade and their mission of inspiring people, so I decided to partner with them to get the word out on how their kombucha can help people to live their version of their happiest and healthiest lives,” Seacrest said of the partnership.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dp8aiuoysnJqboprAtXnSqZynnKNigXZ8jKagpaSZpLtuusStZLCnoqm1cA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthis-is-how-ryan-seacrest-spends-his-450-million-net-worth.html&text=This%20Is%20How%20Ryan%20Seacrest%20Spends%20His%20%24450%20Million%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthis-is-how-ryan-seacrest-spends-his-450-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthis-is-how-ryan-seacrest-spends-his-450-million-net-worth.html&title=This%20Is%20How%20Ryan%20Seacrest%20Spends%20His%20%24450%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthis-is-how-ryan-seacrest-spends-his-450-million-net-worth.html&title=This%20Is%20How%20Ryan%20Seacrest%20Spends%20His%20%24450%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthis-is-how-ryan-seacrest-spends-his-450-million-net-worth.html&title=This%20Is%20How%20Ryan%20Seacrest%20Spends%20His%20%24450%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthis-is-how-ryan-seacrest-spends-his-450-million-net-worth.html&description=This%20Is%20How%20Ryan%20Seacrest%20Spends%20His%20%24450%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./why-does-lorde-take-so-much-time-between-album-releases.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Does Lorde Take So Much Time Between Album Releases?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-real-reason-katie-holmes-has-avoided-racy-roles-throughout-her-career.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Real Reason Katie Holmes Has Avoided Racy Roles Throughout Her Career">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
