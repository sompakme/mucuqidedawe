They were later seen a week later at LAX, where they exchanged kisses and a quick embrace.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The pair haven’t confirmed their romance, but it appears he’s moving forward in his divorce from Tori after nearly 20 years of marriage. “They’re headed for divorce,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source recently told Us Weekly</a>. “It’s been that way for a while.”</p><p>The insider claims that Tori is miffed by Dean’s recent behavior, and even more, that he’s been neglectful of their family since initiating a divorce and starting a new romance.</p><p>“Dean stepping out with a new woman since he hadn’t been seen in a long time is disrespectful to Tori,” the source claimed. “He hasn’t been as actively engaged with the family since they separated.”</p><p>They also denied that Tori would be willing to reconcile. “She’s over it,” they went on. “Tori is focusing on herself and her personal well-being with the kids. She wants to close the chapter with Dean.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For now, it appears the former 90210 star is focusing on her children, while Dean is invested in his new relationship. Together, the estranged pair share sons Liam, 16, Finn, 11, and Beau, 6, and daughters Stella, 15, and Hattie, 12. They’ve been married since 2006.</p><p>“[Tori] is very protective of her kids. They’ve become closer to Tori and she has stepped up to [the] plate and taken control in making sure they’re happy and healthy,” the insider continued. “And she’s doing her best to provide for her kids.”</p><h2 id=dean-deleted-his-divorce-announcement-and-hasn-rsquo-t-officially-filed>Dean Deleted His Divorce Announcement And Hasn’t Officially Filed</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar52800632.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dean was first seen with Lily four months after announcing via social media he was divorcing Tori. “It’s with great sadness and a very very heavy heart that after 18 years together and 5 amazing children, that @torispelling and I have decided to go our separate ways and start a new journey of our own,” the statement, shared on June 17th, read.</p><p>“We will continue to work together as loving parents and guide and love our children through this difficult time,” it continued. “We ask that you all respect our privacy as we take this time to surround our family with love and work our way through this. Thank you all for your support and kindness.”</p><p>However, he deleted the post shortly afterwards, and no official statement about splitting up came from Tori, leading fans to believe the long-time couple had reconciled.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Dean’s recent sightings with his new love interest as well as Tori’s reported frustration with her husband’s behavior seems to imply these two are done for good. However, it hasn’t been confirmed whether Dean has officially filed for divorce, so the estranged pair’s next move remains to be seen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirqKqZYsCxsculoKefXaeyoq%2FToqanZZSarq95zJybnqqdpMG1ecOaq6Kml2K7psOMsKammZ5irq61w2aboq6fp7Cmew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftori-spelling-reacts-to-dean-mcdermott-stepping-out-with-mystery-woman-after-denying-divorce.html&text=Tori%20Spelling%20Reacts%20To%20Dean%20McDermott%20Stepping%20Out%20With%20Mystery%20Woman%20After%20Denying%20Divorce&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftori-spelling-reacts-to-dean-mcdermott-stepping-out-with-mystery-woman-after-denying-divorce.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftori-spelling-reacts-to-dean-mcdermott-stepping-out-with-mystery-woman-after-denying-divorce.html&title=Tori%20Spelling%20Reacts%20To%20Dean%20McDermott%20Stepping%20Out%20With%20Mystery%20Woman%20After%20Denying%20Divorce" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftori-spelling-reacts-to-dean-mcdermott-stepping-out-with-mystery-woman-after-denying-divorce.html&title=Tori%20Spelling%20Reacts%20To%20Dean%20McDermott%20Stepping%20Out%20With%20Mystery%20Woman%20After%20Denying%20Divorce" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftori-spelling-reacts-to-dean-mcdermott-stepping-out-with-mystery-woman-after-denying-divorce.html&title=Tori%20Spelling%20Reacts%20To%20Dean%20McDermott%20Stepping%20Out%20With%20Mystery%20Woman%20After%20Denying%20Divorce" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftori-spelling-reacts-to-dean-mcdermott-stepping-out-with-mystery-woman-after-denying-divorce.html&description=Tori%20Spelling%20Reacts%20To%20Dean%20McDermott%20Stepping%20Out%20With%20Mystery%20Woman%20After%20Denying%20Divorce" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./15-hidden-secrets-you-never-knew-about-brothels.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Hidden Secrets You Never Knew About Brothels">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-highest-grossing-mark-wahlberg-movies-ranked.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Highest-Grossing Mark Wahlberg Movies, Ranked">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
