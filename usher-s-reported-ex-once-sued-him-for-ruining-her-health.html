It’s hard to imagine that just a few years ago, the singer was also embroiled in a bizarre lawsuit involving an ex-girlfriend.</p><h2 id=a-former-romantic-partner-accused-usher-of-ruining-her-health>A Former Romantic Partner Accused Usher Of Ruining Her Health</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/usher-pictured-at-the-jimmy-kimmel-live-show.jpg><p>It all started in July 2017 when a woman who only referred to herself as Jane Doe filed a suit against Usher, seeking $10 million in damages. The woman claimed that she and the singer became intimate after hooking up in Atlanta in April of that year.</p><p>During this time, Jane Doe claimed that she was intimate with the singer and that he always wore protection.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When the two met again in a New Orleans hotel room 12 days later, however, Jane Doe alleged that they did not use protection. Months later, she heard reports about Usher admitting that he has Herpes Simplex 2 and filed the suit because she was unknowingly “exposed.”</p><p>Jane Doe also went on to state that she wouldn’t have become intimate with the singer had she known about his alleged herpes.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Happened Between Justin Timberlake And Usher?</a></span></p><p>Later on, Jane Doe, who eventually revealed herself to be Laura Helm, upped her suit to $20 million after a test reportedly confirmed that she, too, contracted the virus. Soon after, however, Helm filed to dismiss the case for technical reasons.</p><p>Later on, the case was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dismissed again</a> after Usher and Helm “reached an amicable resolution.” The terms of their settlement were never made public.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=usher-also-faced-similar-accusations-from-other-parties>Usher Also Faced Similar Accusations From Other Parties</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/usher-performs-live-in-philadelphia-in-2014.jpg><p>Following the dismissal of Helm’s suit against Usher, however, another party came forward with similar accusations against the singer. This time, Quantasia Sharpton, along with a Jane Doe and John Doe, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">took the singer to court in Los Angeles</a>.</p><p>This time, the complaint referenced a settlement that Usher made in 2012 with a woman (the singer’s stylist) who claimed that the singer transmitted his alleged disease to her.</p><p>Because of that settlement and Usher never having denied the claims publicly, the suit stated that there is a “legal presumption” that the singer “adopts the accusation as his admission.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Each of the plaintiffs in this suit also claimed that they were intimate with the singer and that he had failed to disclose that he had Herpes Simplex II Virus prior to the interaction. They also said that they were unaware of the herpes claims against Usher until 2017 (possibly, when the case involving Helm was made public).</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Just How Much Jenn Goicoechea Was Worth Before Becoming Usher's Baby Mama</a></span></p><p>Sharpton and her fellow plaintiffs also insisted that Usher never tried to contact them to refute reports regarding his alleged herpes infection and that they could not contact the singer because he would call them using “burner phones.”</p><p>Since the suit was made public, a hotel employee has also come forward to corroborate Sharpton’s claims of being intimate with the singer. According to a report from TMZ, Sharpton may have first interacted with Usher when she attended his concert in Atlantic City, New Jersey in 2014.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Published photographic evidence</a> shows Sharpton alongside August Alsina, who had been Usher’s opening act at the concert.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During Sharpton’s press conference with lawyer Lisa Bloom, it was claimed that Sharpton was picked from the crowd to meet the singer backstage. One of Usher’s staff was said to have taken down her phone number and later on, Sharpton reportedly received a call from the singer, which is how they ended up meeting at the Days Inn, which is near the concert venue.</p><p>One of the staff who works at Days Inn claims to have seen Usher appear in the hotel lobby shortly after midnight. She says that she also saw Sharpton come down and greet the singer. Afterward, Usher allegedly brought Sharpton to his hotel room.</p><p>Sources close to the singer, however, have since denied that he ever hooked up with Sharpton. In 2019, it was revealed that Bloom filed to have Sharpton’s suit dismissed. Unlike in the case of Helm, however, it is unclear if there was a settlement involved.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=since-the-charges-have-been-dropped-such-suits-against-usher-have-become-an-onstage-joke>Since The Charges Have Been Dropped, Such Suits Against Usher Have Become An Onstage Joke</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/usher-arrives-at-the-jimmy-kimmel-live-show.jpg><p>To be clear, however, Usher himself knew the jokes were coming beforehand as the one who took them to the stage is none other than his good friend, Tiffany Haddish.</p><p>During a 2022 interview with Cosmopolitan, the comedian admitted to having a joke that goes, “I curse you out with joy. I hope that you spread it. I hope you spread it like Usher spreads herpes.” Haddish also revealed that she even told Usher about the joke.</p><p>And while some may have expected Usher to take offense, it turns out he was fine with it. Usher reportedly told Haddish she was crazy, but didn't confirm or deny the rumor.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Happened Between Usher And T-Pain?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since then, it’s also worth noting that lawsuits against Usher that are similar in nature to Helm’s and Sharpton’s have ceased (although he still occasionally gets<strong> </strong><a href=#>trolled for it</a>). And while Haddish might keep those jokes coming, Usher is living his life just fine.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdqsCpsdFmnqKulWK1qr%2BMnq9mmZ5iwLWwjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fusher-s-reported-ex-once-sued-him-for-ruining-her-health.html&text=Usher%27s%20Reported%20Ex%20Once%20Sued%20Him%20For%20Ruining%20Her%20Health&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fusher-s-reported-ex-once-sued-him-for-ruining-her-health.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fusher-s-reported-ex-once-sued-him-for-ruining-her-health.html&title=Usher%27s%20Reported%20Ex%20Once%20Sued%20Him%20For%20Ruining%20Her%20Health" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fusher-s-reported-ex-once-sued-him-for-ruining-her-health.html&title=Usher%27s%20Reported%20Ex%20Once%20Sued%20Him%20For%20Ruining%20Her%20Health" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fusher-s-reported-ex-once-sued-him-for-ruining-her-health.html&title=Usher%27s%20Reported%20Ex%20Once%20Sued%20Him%20For%20Ruining%20Her%20Health" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fusher-s-reported-ex-once-sued-him-for-ruining-her-health.html&description=Usher%27s%20Reported%20Ex%20Once%20Sued%20Him%20For%20Ruining%20Her%20Health" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-was-the-worst-guest-on-andy-cohen-s-watch-what-happens-live.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who was the worst guest on Andy Cohen's Watch What Happens Live?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./update-final-teams-announced-for-pwg-ddt4-tournament-first-round-matches-set.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Update: Final Teams Announced for PWG DDT4 Tournament: First-Round Matches Set">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
