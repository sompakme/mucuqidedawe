Sure, <a href=#>there were some duds</a>, but enough success stories emerged to keep people flocking to auditions. To date, Kelly Clarkson remains one of the show's biggest success stories.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clarkson has had a wonderful post-Idol career, even pivoting to judging duties on The Voice, <a href=#>pocketing millions while doing so</a>. Kelly is loved on the show, but she recently announced that she won't be around this season, a decision that fans were stunned to hear.</p><p>Let's take a closer look at Clarkson, and learn why she is skipping out on The Voice's upcoming season.</p><h2 id=kelly-clarkson-39-s-life-completely-changed-in-2002>Kelly Clarkson's Life Completely Changed In 2002</h2><p>Summer 2002 marked the start of American Idol a brand new reality competition show that promised to find the next singing star from Anytown USA. The concept was solid, but the execution was brilliant, and in the end, Kelly Clarkson was crowned the first ever winner of the beloved show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following her win, Clarkson lived up to expectations, selling millions of records globally, while cementing her place in music history. She set a high bar for future winners, one that few have even come close to matching.</p><p>Over time, Clarkson would add a number if impressive accolades to her list of accomplishments. Music was more than enough to keep her relevant, but she tacked on acting, hosting duties, and so much more in the years following her Idol victory.</p><p>In recent years, Clarkson has made a successful pivot to the small screen, even taking on judging duties on a competition show that has seemingly overtaken the show that made her a star many years ago.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kelly Clarkson Vacations With Ex-Husband Despite Explosive Split</a></span></p><h2 id=kelly-clarkson-joined-the-voice-in-2017>Kelly Clarkson Joined The Voice In 2017</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it was announced that Kelly Clarkson was going to join The Voice, fans were both shocked and excited. Clarkson, after all, is a former American Idol winner, but that didn't stop her from changing teams later in her career.</p><p>"I’m so excited to join ‘The Voice’ at NBC. We’ve gone back and forth about a role as a coach for years, but the timing hasn’t been right until now. I have always loved appearing on the show as an adviser or performer and established an amazing relationship with the network during my Christmas special. I can’t wait to turn my chair and see the faces of up-and-coming artists and provide them with the help and support they’ve needed to break into the industry. Watch out Shelton, I’m comin’ to win!!" Clarkson said during <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her casting announcement in 2017</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During her time on the show, Clarkson has been a breath of fresh air. She's tailor-made for TV, and she has great rapport with her fellow judges, as well as the contestants.</p><p>Clarkson's time on the show has been memorable, but recently, she announced that she would not be participating in the upcoming season, something that fans were saddened to hear.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Kelly Clarkson And Brandon Blackstock's Divorce Settlement 'Fair'?</a></span></p><h2 id=spending-time-with-her-family-caused-kelly-clarkson-39-s-voice-departure>Spending Time With Her Family Caused Kelly Clarkson's Voice Departure</h2><p>So, why is Kelly Clarkson taking a step back from the beloved competition show? Turns out, it's all about making time for what's important in her personal life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I've decided this year there's just [going to] be a couple of changes for me that I can't say here. There's a couple things happening. I've been able to make more time just for me and my kiddos and still be able to work. Just where we can get away on weekends and really do some fun stuff with my kids," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Clarkson said</a>.</p><p>That's a totally reasonable rationale for wanting to step away from work priorities. Time is a valuable commodity, and Clarkson clearly sees that she needs to utilize her time in a fresh way, one that includes her family unit.</p><p>"They only want to hang out with you for so long and that's now so I got to take advantage of that. I'm excited to have more time with them. I mean I have a ton of time in the morning but I don't know, I'm selfish. They're fun," she continued.</p><p>Even though fans were upset to learn of Clarkson's departure, most were understanding of her reasoning behind it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Camila Cabello will serve in Clarkson's stead this upcoming season. Cabello is not nearly as loved as Clarkson is with the masses, but she has participated on the show previously, so she should be able to go great things while the cameras are rolling.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened Between Kelly Clarkson And Clive Davis?</a></span></p><p>Kelly Clarkson's decision to step away from The Voice is an understandable one, and fans are optimistic that it won't be a permanent switch.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrCwutWipZydlGK4prjLsmScpJGnuLS7zWarqGWcmq63sYytn55lpqS2pLGO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-could-possibly-have-convinced-kelly-clarkson-to-leave-the-voice.html&text=What%20Could%20Possibly%20Have%20Convinced%20Kelly%20Clarkson%20To%20Leave%20The%20Voice%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-could-possibly-have-convinced-kelly-clarkson-to-leave-the-voice.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-could-possibly-have-convinced-kelly-clarkson-to-leave-the-voice.html&title=What%20Could%20Possibly%20Have%20Convinced%20Kelly%20Clarkson%20To%20Leave%20The%20Voice%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-could-possibly-have-convinced-kelly-clarkson-to-leave-the-voice.html&title=What%20Could%20Possibly%20Have%20Convinced%20Kelly%20Clarkson%20To%20Leave%20The%20Voice%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-could-possibly-have-convinced-kelly-clarkson-to-leave-the-voice.html&title=What%20Could%20Possibly%20Have%20Convinced%20Kelly%20Clarkson%20To%20Leave%20The%20Voice%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-could-possibly-have-convinced-kelly-clarkson-to-leave-the-voice.html&description=What%20Could%20Possibly%20Have%20Convinced%20Kelly%20Clarkson%20To%20Leave%20The%20Voice%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-happened-to-tania-raymonde-after-her-brief-big-bang-theory-cameo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened To Tania Raymonde After Her Brief Big Bang Theory Cameo?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-cast-of-one-tree-hill-where-are-they-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Cast Of 'One Tree Hill': Where Are They Now?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
