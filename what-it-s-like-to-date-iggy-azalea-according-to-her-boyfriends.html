Azalea is called the rap princess. In addition, she is known for her chic body shape. But what about her personal life? Here are all the details about her boyfriends and what it's like to date her according to them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=iggy-doesn-39-t-let-others-to-mess-with-her>Iggy Doesn't Let Others To Mess With Her</h2><p>Iggy has always been honest and open about her past. Including who she has dated and what sorts of things she's been through. Granted, having a s** tape released takes things to a whole new level.</p><p>When Iggy was 17, she started her first serious relationship with rapper Hefe Wine who was almost twice her age. Maurice Williams, who also goes by Hefe Wine, claimed to have a s** tape and even being her husband. However, after a bitter legal battle, Iggy won the case and made clear that no one can't mess with her. She dated Wine from 2008 to 2010.</p><h2 id=passionate-and-hard-working>Passionate and Hard Working</h2><p>Several months after <a href=#>Iggy started dating rapper A$AP Rocky</a>, she got a tattoo with his name on her fingers: Live, Love, A$AP. Their affair was bright (from 2011 to 2012), but they'd split by the end of the year, and Azalea removed the tattoo.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Bhad Bhabie Feels About Cardi B, Iggy Azalea, And Other Female Rappers</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although they only dated for a year, A$AP Rocky defended her when people criticized Iggy for her massive success in 2015. He told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billboard</a>, "That [situation with Iggy] is unfortunate because nobody wants to be portrayed that way. I'm quite sure she doesn't. I think she works hard like the rest of us."</p><h2 id=iggy-won-39-t-forgive-anyone-cheating-on-her>Iggy Won't Forgive Anyone Cheating on Her</h2><p>The rapper and the NBA player, Nick Young, started his relationship with Iggy after he called her his WomanCrushWednesday. On Nick's 30th birthday in 2015, he popped the question, and the two began making plans to walk down the aisle. But, the couple needed to put the wedding on pause due to Iggy's music career. After a while, she learned about the betrayal of her sweetheart and canceled the engagement. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Azalea said that she could no longer trust him</a> despite her big love, and the relationship could not be restored. Their story ended in such a way. They dated from 2013 to 2016.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=iggy-likes-to-be-spoiled-yet-she-39-s-very-affectionate>Iggy Likes To Be Spoiled Yet She's Very Affectionate</h2><p>Almost straight after breaking up with Young, Azalea had a new boyfriend: Rapper French Montana. Their romance lasted for about half a year (during 2016), and there didn't seem to be any hard feelings. When they were together, Montana bought her seven diamond rings. Although they dated only for a couple of months, it's clear that Iggy likes to be spoiled with fancy jewelry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hip-hop producer Ljay Currie became Iggy's next affection. The two were romantically linked from December 2016 to June 2017. It's not clear exactly why they ended things. However, they liked to travel and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">put on a loved-up display in public places</a>. There are many pictures of Iggy passionately kissing Currie during a trip to Mexico.</p><h2 id=she-loves-dating-rappers>She Loves Dating Rappers</h2><p>In the fall of 2017, Azalea and Quavo were working together on Savior, and it was seen that they were more than just friends. Later, Iggy stated that she was very grateful to him for supporting her in challenging moments. Once again, she fell head over heels in love with a rapper.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Did Iggy Azalea Ever Date Tristan Thompson?</a></span></p><p>In 2018, it was rumored that Iggy and TYGA had a love affair, but she never confirmed it. They both attended Coachella, spent some time there together but nothing more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The same year, Azalea confirmed that her relationship status had changed when she started dating NFL player DeAndre Hopkins. But she took her words back in a day and said that she was single again.</p><h2 id=who-is-the-father-of-iggy-azalea-39-s-child>Who Is the Father of Iggy Azalea's Child?</h2><p><a href=#>Playboi Carti and Iggy's story began in 2018</a>, but they made it official only in 2019. Very soon, Azalea and Carti settled together in Atlanta, and Iggy flashed an engagement ring during one of her interviews. By the end of the year, it became known that the rapper was six months pregnant. The happy couple became parents in the spring of 2020. <a href=#>Azalea gave birth to a boy named Onyx Kelly</a>.</p><p>Like many other couples, it seems like quarantine got the best of their relationship as they broke up a couple of months ago. Iggy announced their relationship status in a series of cryptic messages on her Instagram story. She wrote, "People take loyalty for granted, and that's why I'd rather be alone."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then Iggy followed up in another post clarifying her cryptic comments and spelled them clearly out for fans. She said, "What I meant last night was that I'm raising my son alone, and I'm not in a relationship." Fans were quick to rally around Iggy and call out Playboi Carti for not being a part of their son's life.</p><p>From what her boyfriends have said about her, it seems like Iggy is an empowered woman that won't settle for less than she deserves.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Leonardo DiCaprio Lost Out On A Role To Appear Alongside Tom Cruise And Brad Pitt</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra1v4yloKSdXam8brDArZxmoZecxm6t2ZqjnpldlrCku9GdoKefXam8brTEq2Sbp6mbv6qxzZ2qaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-it-s-like-to-date-iggy-azalea-according-to-her-boyfriends.html&text=What%20It%27s%20Like%20To%20Date%20Iggy%20Azalea%2c%20According%20To%20Her%20Boyfriends&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-it-s-like-to-date-iggy-azalea-according-to-her-boyfriends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-it-s-like-to-date-iggy-azalea-according-to-her-boyfriends.html&title=What%20It%27s%20Like%20To%20Date%20Iggy%20Azalea%2c%20According%20To%20Her%20Boyfriends" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-it-s-like-to-date-iggy-azalea-according-to-her-boyfriends.html&title=What%20It%27s%20Like%20To%20Date%20Iggy%20Azalea%2c%20According%20To%20Her%20Boyfriends" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-it-s-like-to-date-iggy-azalea-according-to-her-boyfriends.html&title=What%20It%27s%20Like%20To%20Date%20Iggy%20Azalea%2c%20According%20To%20Her%20Boyfriends" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-it-s-like-to-date-iggy-azalea-according-to-her-boyfriends.html&description=What%20It%27s%20Like%20To%20Date%20Iggy%20Azalea%2c%20According%20To%20Her%20Boyfriends" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./why-hugh-grant-once-spent-3-5-million-on-an-andy-warhol-painting.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Hugh Grant Once Spent $3.5 Million On An Andy Warhol Painting">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-temptations-singer-dies-at-age-74.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Temptations Singer Dies At Age 74">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
