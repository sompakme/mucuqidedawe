In between time bending and variant mayhem, a brand-new face of Loki was introduced, Sylvie Laufeydottir. Portrayed by British star Sophia Di Martino, the introduction of the character left fans divided. Many felt as though she<a href=#> “ruined” the show</a> whilst others became enamored by lady Loki. Regardless, it's safe to say that Di Martino made her mark on the MCU.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Tom Hiddleston Is Embracing His Character's Sexual Orientation And Gender Identity On 'Loki'</a></span></p><p>Prior to joining the cinematic universe, however, <a href=#>Di Martino was an already well-established actress</a> and professional. Her role in the British dark comedy, Flowers, showcased how the seasoned actress is able to balance a range of themes and genres in a performance. Not only this, but the series also showcased how Di Martino was able to balance her work and personal life as she worked alongside her husband Will Sharpe. The talented pair share a beautiful relationship and have even welcomed two adorable babies, one in 2019 and one in 2021. So let’s take a deeper look into who Sharpe is and the work that he has done.</p><h2 id=will-sharpe-has-many-impressive-directing-credits-to-his-name><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Will Sharpe Has Many Impressive Directing Credits To His Name</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The talented Japanese-English creative seems to have made his mark in British film and television. After 14 years in the industry, the 35-year-old has successfully achieved to create and lead several productions resulting in a number of directing credits to his name. His most notable directing credits include the acclaimed British shows, Landscapers and Flowers. Sharpe is also widely recognized as a director for his 2021 film, The Electrical Life Of Louis Wain. The film starred Doctor Strange star, Benedict Cumberbatch, and followed the story of the iconic English artist Louis Wain.</p><h2 id=will-sharpe-is-also-a-talented-screenwriter><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Will Sharpe Is Also A Talented Screenwriter</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As Sharpe continues to make a name for himself as a director, he also continues to develop his craft as a screenwriter. For many of his directing credits, the skilled creative is also credited as a writer. For his dark comedy, Flowers, Sharpe showcased his writing talents in 6 out of 12 episodes. Sharpe also co-wrote 2 episodes of Landscapers as well as being the sole writer of his film, The Electrical Life Of Louis Wain.</p><h2 id=will-sharpe-even-dabbles-in-the-world-of-acting><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Will Sharpe Even Dabbles In The World Of Acting</span></h2><p>Not only is Sharpe incredibly talented in the behind-the-scenes creative roles, but he has also proved to be a triple threat through his acting roles. With over 15 acting credits to his name, Sharpe is perhaps best recognized on screen through his role as Rodney in the 2019 drama Giri/Haji through which he was awarded a BAFTA award for best supporting actor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>‘Loki’ Star Reveals Sylvie’s Final Duel Was Inspired By Angelina Jolie & Brad Pitt</a></span></p><h2 id=the-talented-triple-threat-compares-his-creative-process-to-surfing><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The Talented Triple Threat Compares His Creative Process To Surfing</span></h2><p>It seems as though Sharpe’s hobbies tend to inspire and influence his creative process as he has previously explained. During an interview with The Guardian, the director, writer, and actor highlighted how he had found great <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">similarities between his writing process and the sport of surfing</a> after having tried his hand at the aquatic activity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actor stated, “When I came back to writing, having been surfing, I found myself reflecting on how there are certain similarities: you have to get everything technically right, but you’re still at the mercy of this much greater power,” Before later adding, “And how 95% of the time you are getting the s**t kicked out of you, but the 5% of the time that it works, it’s so exhilarating you just want to do it again straight away.”</p><h2 id=will-sharpe-rsquo-s-peers-would-describe-him-as-having-a-lsquo-wonderfully-creative-mind-rsquo><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Will Sharpe’s Peers Would Describe Him As Having A ‘Wonderfully Creative Mind’</span></h2><p>Later on, in the Guardian interview, Sharpe touched on what it had been like to work with some of the biggest names in the acting world. After having worked with Academy Award-winning star Olivia Coleman twice in both Flowers and Landscapers the talented actress had some kind words to say about Sharpe. She praised his ethic as a creator and even highlighted him having a “wonderfully creative mind”.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actress stated, “I had loved working with Will on Flowers. He has the most wonderfully creative mind, and as a director, I loved the notes he gave me.”</p><h2 id=will-sharpe-is-introverted-due-to-his-upbringing><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Will Sharpe Is Introverted Due To His Upbringing</span></h2><p>Sharpe spent his early years in his hometown of Tokyo, Japan. After moving to England at the age of 8 years old, Sharpe has stated to have developed a sense of dual identity in which he felt Japanese in England and British in Japan. During the Guardian interview, Sharpe highlighted this as he detailed the ways in which his upbringing had impacted the way he presented himself socially.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sharpe stated, “If you’re mixed-race, when you’re in Japan you feel British, and when you’re in England you feel Japanese,” Before later adding, “You’re trying to get your feet on the ground wherever you go. I definitely found it took some adjustment moving to England from Japan, and I think that has given me perhaps an outsider’s perspective on here. In the same way that I have an outsider’s perspective on there.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is What Gugu Mbatha-Raw Did When She Got Cast In Loki</a></span></p><h2 id=these-are-will-sharpe-rsquo-s-main-creative-influences><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>These Are Will Sharpe’s Main Creative Influences</span></h2><p>Sharpe has previously also stated how his Japanese heritage has influenced his creative process and work as a writer-director. During a discussion with BAFTA Guru, Sharpe highlighted how his work on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Flowers had been influenced by the early Japanese comedies</a> that he grew up watching.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whilst speaking about his character, Shun, on the show Sharpe stated, “The character of Shun I think was born out of my desire to inject into the show a sense of the Japanese comedies that I grew up watching as a kid,” Before later adding, “Some of my earliest comedy memories are these really silly Japanese sketch shows.”</p><h2 id=will-sharpe-is-passionate-about-portraying-mental-illness-on-screen><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Will Sharpe Is Passionate About Portraying Mental Illness On Screen</span></h2><p>Later on in the BAFTA Guru discussion, Sharpe opened up about the concept of mental illness on screen and specifically how Flowers portrayed that. His passion for the subject was clear throughout the video as he praised the cast of the series for being able to eloquently portray these themes whilst still bringing forth that comedic tone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Owen Wilson Goes Gray For Marvel's New 'Loki' Series</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijqKOZYsC1rdFmqqiomJ6ubrDIZqSaqqSeu7B51qGmZqGjYrW2v8GapZ1lp565rXnSoZirqJVk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-loki-star-sophia-di-martino-s-filmmaker-husband.html&text=Who%20Is%20Loki%20Star%20Sophia%20Di%20Martino%27s%20Filmmaker%20Husband%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-loki-star-sophia-di-martino-s-filmmaker-husband.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-loki-star-sophia-di-martino-s-filmmaker-husband.html&title=Who%20Is%20Loki%20Star%20Sophia%20Di%20Martino%27s%20Filmmaker%20Husband%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-loki-star-sophia-di-martino-s-filmmaker-husband.html&title=Who%20Is%20Loki%20Star%20Sophia%20Di%20Martino%27s%20Filmmaker%20Husband%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-loki-star-sophia-di-martino-s-filmmaker-husband.html&title=Who%20Is%20Loki%20Star%20Sophia%20Di%20Martino%27s%20Filmmaker%20Husband%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-loki-star-sophia-di-martino-s-filmmaker-husband.html&description=Who%20Is%20Loki%20Star%20Sophia%20Di%20Martino%27s%20Filmmaker%20Husband%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./8-boxing-stars-that-were-out-of-control-and-8-who-are-squeaky-clean.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="8 Boxing Stars That Were Out Of Control (And 8 Who Are Squeaky Clean)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-jay-baruchel-wife-rebecca-jo-dunham-baruchel-meet-the-canadian-actor-and-his-spouse-on-insta.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Jay Baruchel Wife Rebecca-Jo Dunham Baruchel?
