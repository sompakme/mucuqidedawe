She joins the long list of artists such as Justin Bieber, who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">have the internet to thank for their success</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When she was five, Lorde joined a drama group to develop her public speaking skills. Little did she know that it was the foundation needed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">develop her lyrical prowess</a>. Lorde turned out to be a gifted child, who floored her peers when it came to speeches. In 2009, her father sent recordings of two songs she’d covered to Universal, leading her to get signed.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Lorde Legs' Just Became A Meme And Fans Are Running With It</a></span></p><p>Since then, she’s released two studio albums, three extended plays, and a number of promotional singles. Her first studio album, Pure Heroine, was released in 2013. Four years later, she released Melodrama&nbsp;and is<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;set to release Solar Power in August</a>. So, what’s with the long gaps between her albums? Let’s find out.</p><h2 id=signing-with-a-major-record-label-too-soon><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Signing With A Major Record Label Too Soon</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most artists sign with major record labels when they have found some sort of commercial success on their own, or with smaller record labels. Take the case of hip-hop mogul Jay-Z, who sold his first records out of the trunk of his car before getting Def Jam onboard, or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Katy Perry</a>, whose 2001 debut album Katy Hudson only sold 200 copies. Lorde signed to Universal at the beginning of her career, robbing her of the flexibility of releasing an album at her own pace.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's The Insect Lorde Secretly Samples In 'Solar Power'</a></span></p><h2 id=making-an-album-is-a-tedious-task><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Making An Album Is A Tedious Task</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lorde’s first years at Universal were bitter-sweet. She got the services of Frances Dickinson, a vocal coach who gave her lessons twice a week for a year. On the flip side, her attempts at getting a songwriter to work with were futile. Lorde took to writing her own songs with the aid of short fiction. When she was finally paired with Joel Little, it took three weeks for them to make her first EP, The Love Club EP.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Why Taylor Swift Doesn't Speak To Lorde Anymore</a></span></p><h2 id=finding-early-success-with-her-first-ep><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Finding Early Success With Her First EP</span></h2><p>The Love Club EP was released independently on Lorde’s SoundCloud. When the label saw that it had been downloaded 60,000 times, it re-released the EP in 2013. The Love Club EP proved to be commercially successful. It peaked at number two in New Zealand, and its lead single, ‘Royals’, became a worldwide hit and peaked at number 1 on Billboard Hot 100. Having achieved success with her very first project, the pressure to make another body of work fast was off the table.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nothing-left-to-prove-the-success-of-pure-heroine><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Nothing Left To Prove: The Success Of ‘Pure Heroine’</span></h2><p>Following the release of her debut EP and its commercial success, it only made sense that Lorde confirms her place in the music industry. Success with one body of work is fine, but following it up proves that an artist is here to stay, regardless of how long it takes to have the next album out. Pure Heroine was released in September of 2013, following her two extended plays, Tennis Court, and Live In Concert. With Pure Heroine as one of 2014’s best-selling albums, Lorde had nothing left to prove.</p><h2 id=music-tours-leave-little-room-for-creativity><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Music Tours Leave Little Room For Creativity</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following the success of Pure Heroine, it was time for Lorde to hit the road. For artists, though music tours are a chance to interact with fans and perform on big stages, they leave no space for the actual recording of music. In between band rehearsals, consistent flights, and jet lags, one can only do so much. The Pure Heroine Tour, for instance, had a record of 103 shows in the United States, Oceania, South America, and Asia. In 2022, the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Solar Power tour will kick-off.</a></p><h2 id=pursuing-charity-projects><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Pursuing Charity Projects</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Lorde is not keeping her fans waiting, she’s deeply invested in ‘other projects’, another name for charity. She’s written songs for charity purposes. Lorde was featured in a compilation album dubbed The Art of Peace: Songs for Tibet II, which was aimed at raising money for the preservation of the Tibetan culture.&nbsp; She also recorded 'Team Ball Player Thing', a charity single. Lorde has generously made donations over the years, including one to Starship hospital.</p><h2 id=keeping-off-social-media-prevents-pressure-to-release-an-album><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Keeping Off Social Media Prevents Pressure To Release An Album</span></h2><p>We’ve seen the script before. Case in point: The ever so talented Rihanna. A celebrity who’s constantly on social media is bound to experience pressure to release another album. In a recent interview, Lorde reveals that she stays off socials. This makes her less susceptible to pressure from the 7.3 million followers she has on Instagram. It lets her create at her own pace, as opposed to releasing an album for the sake of it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=collaborations-with-other-artists><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Collaborations With Other Artists</span></h2><p>When Lorde is not releasing critically acclaimed singles and albums, she’s collaborating with other artists. In 2015, she featured on the song ‘Magnets’ by Disclosure. The same happened in 2020, where she collaborated with Son Lux on the song ‘Switch Screens’. In 2017, Lorde made a remix of her song ‘Homemade Dynamite’ that featured Khalid, Post Malone, and SZA.</p><h2 id=she-s-writing-songs-for-other-artistes><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>She’s Writing Songs For Other Artistes</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Besides being a great singer and a best-selling artist, should Lorde ever decide to quit making music, she’d still have a solid career in the music industry as a songwriter. Lorde is credited for writing/co-writing ‘All My Love’ by Major Lazer and Ariana Grande, ‘Heartlines’ by Broods off the album Conscious, and ‘Don’t Take the Money’ by Bleachers, off the album Gone Now.</p><h2 id=then-there-s-the-global-pandemic><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Then There’s The Global Pandemic</span></h2><p>Lorde’s writing process for her upcoming Album was delayed by the pandemic. In a recent interview, she revealed that she and Jack, with whom she had been writing songs, could not see each other for six months, making the writing process difficult. She however mentioned that the album’s lead single, 'Solar Power,' was written in 2019.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Real Reason Why Lorde Deleted All Her Social Media</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbymv4ylpquclWLBorfEZqqoZZ2qsKl506KknmWSmsG4scSnZJqkkqq6br7EpZyaq5WofA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-does-lorde-take-so-much-time-between-album-releases.html&text=Why%20Does%20Lorde%20Take%20So%20Much%20Time%20Between%20Album%20Releases%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-does-lorde-take-so-much-time-between-album-releases.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-does-lorde-take-so-much-time-between-album-releases.html&title=Why%20Does%20Lorde%20Take%20So%20Much%20Time%20Between%20Album%20Releases%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-does-lorde-take-so-much-time-between-album-releases.html&title=Why%20Does%20Lorde%20Take%20So%20Much%20Time%20Between%20Album%20Releases%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-does-lorde-take-so-much-time-between-album-releases.html&title=Why%20Does%20Lorde%20Take%20So%20Much%20Time%20Between%20Album%20Releases%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-does-lorde-take-so-much-time-between-album-releases.html&description=Why%20Does%20Lorde%20Take%20So%20Much%20Time%20Between%20Album%20Releases%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./before-fame-florence-pugh-worried-about-people-finding-out-one-detail-about-her.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Before Fame, Florence Pugh Worried About People Finding Out One Detail About Her">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./this-is-how-ryan-seacrest-spends-his-450-million-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="This Is How Ryan Seacrest Spends His $450 Million Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
