While this may not be a big deal to some, considering that Kanye was considered a longtime family friend to the power couple, many fans took it as a clear sign that there had been a lot of friction formed between the Carters and the Wests.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s long been rumored that Beyonce and Jay distanced themselves from Kanye after learning about his relationship with <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian</a></strong>, whom he has since married and welcomed four children.</p><p>To make matters worse, the two also didn’t attend their wedding in 2014, which the “Good Life” rapper clearly took issue with — but the revelation that his kids have never shared playdates with Jay and Bey’s offsprings made it apparent how intense their feud had gotten over the years.</p><h2 id=has-blue-ivy-met-north-west>Has Blue Ivy Met North West?</h2><p>According to reports, Blue Ivy and North West have never met or shared any sort of encounter with one another. There was, however, an event back in January 2020 held by Interscope Records executive and music producer Jimmy Iovine, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">which Kim and Jay Z both attended</a>, along with several of their kids.</p><p>Kim was believed to have taken Saint, Chicago, and Psalm, to the occasion while the “Hard Knock Life” hitmaker was accompanied by Blue Ivy, Rumi, and Sir.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Much Does Kim Kardashian Make On Instagram Compared To Filming ‘KUWTK’?</a></span></p><p>Interestingly enough, Beyonce, Kanye West, and North West weren’t present at the occurrence, meaning that Kim’s oldest daughter missed out on a fun playdate with Blue.</p><p>Their get-together was brief and from what sources have gathered, neither Kim nor Jay Z were even aware that they would be at the event — needless to say, though, their kids appeared to have had a good time getting to know one another.</p><p>It just seems unfortunate that Blue and North have yet to share a playdate considering that they’re both in the same age group — after all, Kanye and Jay Z, who once called the “Monster” rapper his brother, were once so close that to think their daughters have never met seems rather bizarre.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In October 2016, an enraged Kanye had ranted during a concert on his Saint Pablo Tour told the audience how Jay Z had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">made no effort in seeing him or his wife</a> following Kim’s robbery ordeal in Paris earlier that month.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Khloé Kardashian Sparks More Pregnancy Rumors As She’s Spotted Filming KUWTK</a></span></p><p>The father of four was baffled that his longtime pal had made little to no effort in checking in on the couple, which led him to discuss some other personal matters concerning his feud with the music mogul, including why fans were never going to get a follow-up to their 2011 collaborative album, Watch The Throne.</p><p>"There will never be a&nbsp;Watch the Throne 2," Kanye gushed. "You know why? Cause that’s the reason why I wasn’t on [Drake’s ’Pop Style.’] Y’all didn’t get, what y’all were supposed to get with me and Drake on this song because of some Tidal/Apple bullshit.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Don’t call me after the robbery and say, ‘How you feelin’?’ You wanna know how I’m feeling? Come by the house. Bring the kids by the house, like we brothers. Let’s sit down. I can’t take this sh**, bro. Our kids ain’t never even played together.”</p><p>The revelation made it apparent that there was tension between Kanye and the Carters, which not only stemmed from the fact that Jay Z made little effort in seeing how the couple was doing after Kim’s robbery but also from the rapper’s supposed distant behavior towards his “brother” ever since he settled down with the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tristan Thompson Comforting Khloé Kardashian As She Cries ‘Non-Stop’ Over The Ending Of ‘KUWTK’</a></span></p><p>In May 2014, when Beyonce and Jay infamously skipped Kim and Kanye’s wedding, the “Empire State of Mind” chart-topper later shared how his marital issues with his wife were at fault for their decision not to attend the couple’s big day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans will recall how just weeks before Kimye’s wedding, Solange had attacked her brother-in-law in an elevator at a Met Gala after-party, with sources claiming that the incident stemmed from Jay’s alleged flirtatious behavior with Rachel Roy, who he was once said to have dated in the early ‘00s</p><p>That same year, plenty of allegations were made against Jay for his cheating ways, which Beyonce later confirmed in her 2016 album, Lemonade.</p><p>In 2018, Jay touched on his reasons for not attending Kimye’s wedding in his song “Friends,” where he raps: “I ain’t going to nobody for nothing when me and my wife beefing / I don’t care if the house on fire, I’m dying, I ain’t leaving. ‘Ty Ty take care of my kids, after he done grieving / If ya’ll don’t understand that, we ain’t meant to be friends.”</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s Why ‘KUWTK’ Might Not Be Over After All</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdna60ec2oqa2gXayytMCMp5yvnaJiwKmt0Z6bZqiclsalrdOeqmavmam1bq7LrpxmoaaufA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-has-north-west-never-shared-playdates-with-blue-ivy.html&text=Why%20Has%20North%20West%20Never%20Shared%20Playdates%20With%20Blue%20Ivy%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-has-north-west-never-shared-playdates-with-blue-ivy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-has-north-west-never-shared-playdates-with-blue-ivy.html&title=Why%20Has%20North%20West%20Never%20Shared%20Playdates%20With%20Blue%20Ivy%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-has-north-west-never-shared-playdates-with-blue-ivy.html&title=Why%20Has%20North%20West%20Never%20Shared%20Playdates%20With%20Blue%20Ivy%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-has-north-west-never-shared-playdates-with-blue-ivy.html&title=Why%20Has%20North%20West%20Never%20Shared%20Playdates%20With%20Blue%20Ivy%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-has-north-west-never-shared-playdates-with-blue-ivy.html&description=Why%20Has%20North%20West%20Never%20Shared%20Playdates%20With%20Blue%20Ivy%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./5-ways-dua-lipa-spends-her-millions.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="5 Ways Dua Lipa Spends Her Millions">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-bachelor-villain-corinne-s-nanny-raquel-5-things.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Bachelor Villain Corinnes Nanny, Raquel? 5 Things">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
