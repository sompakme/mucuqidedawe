Thankfully, he's not a part of the group of celebrities like Nicholas Cage, Leonardo DiCaprio, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Johnny Depp, who all collect some bizarre things.</a></p><p>The story of how he purchased&nbsp;a $3 million Andy Warhol painting is, however, interesting.</p><h2 id=he-made-the-decision-on-a-whim>He Made The Decision On A Whim</h2><p>Only celebrities and the rich can make the decision to buy an Andy Warhol painting on a whim, and that's exactly what Grant did.</p><p>When Grant purchased Andy Warhol's painting of the icon, Elizabeth Taylor, people were surprised to hear Grant was investing in art, and that he was able to secure such a famous painting.</p><p>But Grant isn't quite&nbsp;an art connoisseur. Buying the painting had nothing to do with a love of art or be interesting in becoming an art collector.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Grant&nbsp;confessed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he was drunk on the night he bought the painting in 2001</a>. According to The Daily Mail, Grant was on a two-day drinking spree when he told his assistant to go out and put a bid in for the piece of artwork at Sotheby's auction in New York.</p><p>"And to my horror, she did, and even worse, got it," Grant said.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Did Hugh Grant Like His Character In ‘The Undoing’?</a></span></p><p>"It all began with drink. I'd been having a drunken dinner with my father the night before, and I said, 'We ought to go see my brother Jamie. You know, the Concorde's amazing.' And he said, 'I hear it is.' So I bought him a Concorde ticket and we went. We had lunch, drank a lot of beer.</p><p>"And I was thinking about some stuff in the Sotheby's auction and I saw the Liz Taylor."</p><p>At the time, Grant was already a household name from starring in some of the '90s best rom-coms, like Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a Funeral. The year he purchased the piece he was starring in Bridget Jones's Diary.&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-sold-it-six-years-later>He Sold It Six Years Later</h2><p>If Grant's $3 million purchase of the piece was unexpected, his sale of it is even more unexpected.</p><p>Warhol had painted&nbsp;a total of 13&nbsp;pictures of the famous actress in the sixties. In 2005, the highest price ever paid for any of the other copies was only about $12 million, by jeweler Laurence Graff. But Grant was able to sell his for a whopping $21 million.</p><p>"I slightly regret selling it now, even though it made me rich," Grant said.</p><p>"Money and art is a funny story, not a sad one," The Guardian wrote at the time. "It's a joke that such inane sums have been paid. It's a farce, not a conspiracy. Good old Hugh Grant for telling it like it was."</p><p>Other publications like The Telegraph&nbsp;thought the final price of the piece was disappointing.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Look Inside Hugh Grant's Relationship With Elizabeth Hurley</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Apparently, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the print of Liz turned Grant into an art collector in the end</a>. According to Amy Cappellazzo, who ran Christie's auction which helped sell the piece, Grant was going to use his earnings on more art.</p><p>"The seller of the Liz is taking advantage of the strength of today’s market and turning his attention to work by younger artists," she said.</p><p>In 2011 another portrait of Liz was sold for what The Hollywood Reporter&nbsp;projected to be $30 million.</p><p>The money from the sale of the print no doubt had a hefty effect on Grant's net worth. This year his net worth has reached $150 million. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Grant's salary is about $10 million, making him one of the highest-paid actors in Hollywood.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Why Hugh Grant Is Not As Charming To The Ladies In Real Life</a></span></p><p>So that would mean the actor received double his salary in the sale of his Warhol print. In other words, Grant basically cashed out, selling it at the perfect time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ironically, Grant's father wasn't impressed by the Concorde's flight to New York. "Halfway across the Atlantic, he's saying, 'Well, it's all very nice, but frankly I prefer Air Kuwait'- his usual way of getting to New York," Grant concluded.</p><p>The flight to procure the print might not have been worth it for Grant's father, but Liz turned out to be a great investment, albeit a drunken one, for Grant. We wish we could randomly bid on a famous piece of art, win it, and eventually maybe sell it, but we can't all be Hugh Grant.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew McConaughey Sets Up Mom With Hugh Grant’s Dad...
